Answer: Cognitively-intact older adults
Source: We present a qualitative study of thirty cognitivelyintact older adults, evaluating their attitudes and emotional reactions towards different types of home robotic devices.

## sample_size
Answer: 30 participants
Source: We conducted 30 in-depth interviews with cognitively-intact older adults in their own homes, evaluating their reactions to videos of six near-future home robotic devices.

## country
Answer: Israel
Source: The study was approved by the ethics committee of the research institute, with reference number 170326... Media Innovation Lab, Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), 46150, Herzliya, Israel.

## age
Answer: 67 to 90 years old (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29)
Source: The study was conducted with 30 participants between the ages of 67 and 90 (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29; 10 male, 20 female).

## gender
Answer: 10 male, 20 female
Source: The study was conducted with 30 participants between the ages of 67 and 90 (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29; 10 male, 20 female).

## demographic_background
Answer: All participants lived in either an apartment (83%) or private home (17%). 60% were completely independent, 20% mainly independent, 7% slightly dependent, and 13% somewhat dependent. Participants were recruited from a database of older-aged volunteers (53.3%) and a home-support program (46.7%). Some participants' native language was English while others spoke the country's local language.
Source: All participants lived in either an apartment (83%) or private home (17%). 60% of the participants were completely independent (received no assistance), 20% were mainly independent (i.e received food catering for convenience), 7% were slightly dependent (received assistance up to once a week), and 13% were somewhat dependent (received assistance more than once a week)... we recruited older adults from two sources: a database of older-aged volunteers who have previously participated in scientific studies on campus (53.3%), and a home-support program for older adults (46.7%)... Some participant's native language was English while others spoke the country's local language.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Cognitively-intact, relatively healthy, active, and independent older adults; participants were screened for cognitive health using informal and, for some, formal assessments.
Source: We focused on cognitively-intact older adults (see cognitive assessment subsection below) with the intent to gain insights on nonclinical subpopulations... Cognitive assessment. Participants that were recruited from the campus database (53.3%) have undergone a formal cognitive assessment. Participants from the home-care program (46.7%) had not undergone a formal assessment, but were recruited through the home-care program administration only if they met certain criteria (physical and cognitive health). In addition, an informal cognitive assessment was performed with all participants during the beginning of the interview.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Four user needs: need for independence, need for control, fear of being replaced, and need for authenticity. Participants wanted robots to have meaningful functions, not threaten their autonomy, not pretend to be human/animal, and not replace them in valued activities.
Source: Our qualitative analysis revealed four user needs that are at risk of being threatened by design aspects of home robots: the need for independence, the need for control, the fear of being replaced, and the need for authenticity.

## application_context
Answer: Home environment for healthy, cognitively-intact older adults
Source: Robotic devices for older adults are becoming a reality. New robots are being introduced for the growing subpopulation of healthy older adults, with an emphasis on supporting the positive aspects of aging... we further restricted our inclusion criteria to older adults who lived at home.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: First encounter; each participant viewed six short videos (45–66 seconds each) of different robots, with a 5–10 minute interview after each video, all in a single session.
Source: Each video clip was individually shown, one by one, on the interviewer's tablet device... After viewing each video, a 5–10 min semistructured interview was conducted regarding the device just seen... This procedure was repeated for all six videos.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative in-depth interviews using video vignettes of six robots, followed by affinity diagram and thematic coding analysis.
Source: We employ qualitative research methods that are considered ideal for exploratory studies... We conducted 30 in-depth interviews... evaluating their reactions to videos of six near-future home robotic devices... We used the affinity diagram and thematic coding methods to uncover older adults' preferences and concerns based on the data gathered in the 30 interviews.

## care_type
Answer: Not focused on a specific care type; general support for healthy aging, including assistive and social functions.
Source: Robotic devices for older adults are becoming a reality. New robots are being introduced for the growing subpopulation of healthy older adults, with an emphasis on supporting the positive aspects of aging.

## robot_type
Answer: Six robots/devices: PR2 (creature-like, mobile, assistive), Nao (creature-like, mobile, service), Paro (creature-like, stationary, companion), ElliQ (object-like, stationary, service), Google Home (object-like, stationary, assistive), Cozmo (object-like, mobile, companion)
Source: The six devices were: PR2, Nao, ElliQ, Cozmo, Paro, and the Google Home. Fig. 1 demonstrates the six devices and their respective design aspects.

## robot_name
Answer: PR2, Nao, Paro, ElliQ, Google Home, Cozmo
Source: The six devices were: PR2, Nao, ElliQ, Cozmo, Paro, and the Google Home.

## design_goal
Answer: To inform the design and implementation of home robots for healthy older adults by mapping their needs and concerns and providing design recommendations.
Source: We present a qualitative study... evaluating their attitudes and emotional reactions towards different types of home robotic devices... We provide recommendations regarding how researchers and designers of home robots can better address the user needs of healthy older adults by leveraging aspects of the robot's function, speech, appearance, size, proactivity, and mobility.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Demonstrated functions included assistive (e.g., cooking, cleaning, reminders), service (e.g., work assistant, event reminders), and companion/social (e.g., interaction, games, pet-like companionship).
Source: The video shows PR2 in a cooking demonstration... Nao... acting as a desktop work assistant... Paro... designed to interact with people, reacting to touch... ElliQ... motivating the user to be active and engaged with family members, reminding the user to take her medicine, arranging rides... Google Home... controlling the lights in the house, answering various questions... Cozmo... play games with users.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Assistive functions for tasks participants do not enjoy or find difficult (e.g., cleaning, reminders); small size; object-like appearance for elegance and non-intrusiveness; meaningful, purposeful functions; some social cues as secondary features.
Source: The most common response (18 quotes) for wanting an assistive device was for it to do errands the older adult didn't enjoy doing themselves... All 15 quotes regarding size indicated a preference toward smaller devices... Those who preferred the device to look like an object said it was because it was "elegant", "beautiful", and "non-intrusive"... participants believed the robot should have a clear function that can enhance their quality of life... participants did appreciate social cues, suggesting they are important for older adults.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Proactivity (robot taking initiative), mobility (moving around), speech (talking), large size, creature-like appearance when main function is companionship, functions that threaten independence or authenticity, or replace valued activities.
Source: Participants rejected proactive robots because they preferred to continue performing activities themselves... Participants explanations for not wanting a moving device included that a moving robot is irritating and that it would "get in the way"... Comments against a talking device indicated strong negative attitudes... All 15 quotes regarding size indicated a preference toward smaller devices... when the social interaction was the robot's main function, several participants expressed a strong rejection towards creature-like appearance... Participants rejected assistance in activities they found personally meaningful, and in many cases found it as a threat to their self-efficacy, raising the concern that the robot will "replace" them.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Openness to technology, desire for assistance in non-valued or difficult tasks, appreciation for meaningful and purposeful functions, preference for small, non-intrusive devices.
Source: Participants were open to both assistive and social functions, but had different reservations for each type... For assistive functions, older adults were willing to accept robot assistance... Participants showed a clear preference toward smaller devices.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Strong desire for independence and control, fear of being replaced, need for authenticity, negative attitudes toward robots that pretend to be human/animal or threaten autonomy, low technology literacy or concerns about complexity.
Source: Four user needs that can be threatened by the introduction of home robots: the need for independence, the need for control, the fear of being replaced, and the need for authenticity... I think it's pretty complicated no? All these machines look pretty complicated.

## engagement
Answer: Mixed engagement; participants expressed both positive and negative reactions depending on specific robot design aspects, with no overt rejection or acceptance overall.
Source: In sum, findings regarding participants' openness to device indicated that older adults do not overtly reject or accept robots. Participants' responses indicated that the negative and positive reactions were evoked by specific design aspects represented by the different robots.

## acceptance
Answer: Conditional acceptance; cognitively-intact older adults are willing to accept robotic devices into their home if their preferences and concerns are addressed.
Source: Our study indicates that cognitively-intact older adults are willing to accept robotic devices into their home, but have very specific preferences and concerns that must be addressed.

## trust
Answer: Trust is linked to authenticity, control, and independence; participants rejected robots that pretended to be something they are not or threatened their autonomy.
Source: Our qualitative analysis revealed four user needs that are at risk of being threatened by design aspects of home robots: the need for independence, the need for control, the fear of being replaced, and the need for authenticity.

## key_findings
Answer: Healthy older adults are open to home robots if their needs for independence, control, authenticity, and not being replaced are respected. Design aspects such as function, speech, appearance, size, proactivity, and mobility strongly influence acceptance. Recommendations include designing small, single-function, authentic robots that support user control and independence.
Source: Our qualitative analysis revealed four user needs that are at risk of being threatened by design aspects of home robots: the need for independence, the need for control, the fear of being replaced, and the need for authenticity... We presented a set of design recommendations, informing designers how they can address high-risk design aspects (function, speech, appearance, size, proactivity, and mobility) and improve acceptance by considering older adults' needs.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include possible interviewer influence, use of video rather than live interaction, reliance on participant honesty, and limited generalizability to other older adult populations.
Source: Our study has several limitations. As a qualitative study based on face-to-face interviews, our interviewers could unknowingly influence an interviewee's responses... our choice of video study rather than live interaction study to introduce the different types of robotic devices may have influenced aspects of the results... the selected participants represent only a specific target group of older adults, and the perceptions of participants are limited to the context of this study.

## testing_context
Answer: Participants' own homes; interviews conducted in the living room of each older adult's home.
Source: The interviews were conducted in the living room of each of the older adults' homes.
