## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, caregivers, and robotics experts
Source: "Domestic robots with conversation capabilities are getting an increasing demand due to the fact that modern lifestyles are driving elderly community into isolation."

## sample_size
Answer: 20 individuals
Source: "The experiment was conducted with the participation of 20 individuals in the age range of 18-58 (Mean-30.8 and Standard Deviation-11.47)."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for affective interaction and interest level estimation in conversation
Source: "One of the requirements of a conversation system is to ensure that all the people involved are interested in carrying out the conversation."

## application_context
Answer: Domestic service robots for elderly care
Source: "Intelligent domestic service robots can be used in elderly care as assistants to care taking professionals or to support the elders for independent living in their own home environment."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use with topic-based conversation sessions
Source: "The system will initiate the conversation with a friendly greeting. The robot and the participant will take turns one after the other until the conversation decision system indicates the user has lost interest of the conversation."

## methodology
Answer: Experimental study with prosodic feature analysis
Source: "The experiment was conducted with the participation of 20 individuals... The system extracts the prosodic features of the vocal response of the user."

## care_type
Answer: Social and cognitive support
Source: "Both physical and cognitive support for the elderly can be given using domestic service robots with socially communicative capabilities."

## robot_type
Answer: Domestic service robot
Source: "Intelligent domestic service robots can be used in elderly care as assistants to care taking professionals or to support the elders for independent living in their own home environment."

## robot_name
Answer: MIRob
Source: "The concept has been implemented on MIRob platform with a Microsoft Kinect sensor attached."

## design_goal
Answer: To estimate user interest level and improve affective interaction
Source: "The final objective of the system is to change the topic of the conversation if the user engagement is at a low value persistently."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Vocal interaction system with prosodic feature analysis
Source: "The system extracts the prosodic features of the vocal response of the user. The affective state is then determined using a trained neural network."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Prosodic feature analysis for affective state determination
Source: "The system extracts the prosodic features of the vocal response of the user. The affective state is then determined using a trained neural network."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Misclassification of affective states due to similar acoustic properties
Source: "The reasons for unsatisfactory performances as given by the participants are... System not being able to identify some of the sarcastic answers given by the participants to convey displeasure."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## engagement
Answer: Estimated via prosodic features and affective state classification
Source: "The affective state for the respective turn of the conversation is stored in a database. It is used to determine whether the affective states are persistent or temporary."

## acceptance
Answer: 70.01% of topic changes and terminations were considered satisfactory
Source: "Of all the changes and terminations 70.01% of them was considered satisfactory by the participants."

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Prosodic features can estimate user interest level, with 70.01% satisfactory performance
Source: "A method was introduced to estimate the interest level of a person who is engaged in a conversation with a human-robot vocal interaction system."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include misclassification of affective states and static threshold for persistent affective states
Source: "The reasons for unsatisfactory performances... System not being able to identify some of the sarcastic answers... The use of a static value of 3 out of the last 4 turns being the same affective state considered as a persistent affective state should change according to the individual."

## testing_context
Answer: Simulated domestic environment
Source: "The experiment was carried out in a simulated domestic environment."
