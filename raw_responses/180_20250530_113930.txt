## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Municipal decision-makers (e.g., social welfare managers, development managers, digitalisation strategists) and older adults in care homes (including those with dementia, somatic, psychiatric, and disabled care).
Source: "The survey's descriptive data collection consisted of which municipality the participant belonged to and which professional position the respondent had to ensure that decision-makers with a broader insight into the municipality's welfare technology answered (e.g., social welfare manager, development manager or digitalisation strategist)." and "More than half of the respondents (N = 87, 52 %) stated that they had companionship robots in care for older adults..."

## sample_size
Answer: 166 municipal respondents (representing 166 municipalities).
Source: "The response rate was 57 % with a total of 166 respondents (95 % confidence level, and 5 % margin of error)."

## country
Answer: Sweden
Source: "Sweden's 290 municipalities were contacted via email to participate in an online survey..." and "Distribution of robot pets across Sweden's municipalities."

## demographic_background
Answer: Professional position of respondents (e.g., social welfare manager, development manager, digitalisation strategist); care recipients include older adults in various care settings (dementia, somatic, psychiatric, disabled, short-term, service house, adult day-care).
Source: "The survey's descriptive data collection consisted of which municipality the participant belonged to and which professional position the respondent had..." and Table 1: "Frequency of robot pets in different municipal care organisations."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Primarily people with dementia; also used in somatic care, psychiatric care, and disabled care. Only one third of people in somatic or short-term care have maintained cognitive ability.
Source: "most commonly for people with dementia to lower stress and increase the feeling of safety." and "only one third of people living in somatic care or short-term care have a maintained cognitive ability and that older adults in somatic care often require the same help as people living in dementia care"

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Lowering stress, increasing the feeling of safety, decreasing loneliness, increasing communication, and improving quality of life for older adults.
Source: "these robots, often in the shape of a household pet, can decrease stress and loneliness while increasing communication and quality of life." and "most commonly for people with dementia to lower stress and increase the feeling of safety."

## application_context
Answer: Care homes for older adults, including dementia care, somatic care, psychiatric care, disabled care, short-term care, service houses, and adult day-care.
Source: "More than half of the municipalities use pet robots for older adults, and most commonly for people with dementia..." and Table 1.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Online survey of all Swedish municipalities.
Source: "Sweden's 290 municipalities were contacted via email to participate in an online survey which concerned the occurrence of companionship robots in care for older adults."

## care_type
Answer: Social companionship care for older adults, including dementia, somatic, psychiatric, disabled, short-term, and adult day-care.
Source: Table 1: "Frequency of robot pets in different municipal care organisations."

## robot_type
Answer: Animal-like robots (cat and dog robots), specifically Joy for All cat, Joy for All dog, JustoCat, and Paro; humanlike robots (Pepper, Furhat) were not found in use.
Source: "The most common robot models were Joy for All cat (75 %), Joy for All dog (27 %) and JustoCat (25 %), compared to humanlike robots, such as Pepper and Furhat, which were not found at all."

## robot_name
Answer: Joy for All cat, Joy for All dog, JustoCat, Paro
Source: "The most common robot models were Joy for All cat (75 %), Joy for All dog (27 %) and JustoCat (25 %), compared to humanlike robots, such as Pepper and Furhat, which were not found at all."

## design_goal
Answer: To decrease stress and loneliness, increase communication and quality of life, and increase the feeling of safety for older adults.
Source: "these robots, often in the shape of a household pet, can decrease stress and loneliness while increasing communication and quality of life." and "most commonly for people with dementia to lower stress and increase the feeling of safety."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Social companionship, providing comfort, reducing stress, increasing safety, and facilitating communication.
Source: "these robots, often in the shape of a household pet, can decrease stress and loneliness while increasing communication and quality of life." and "most commonly for people with dementia to lower stress and increase the feeling of safety."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Affordability (Joy for All models are significantly cheaper), animal-like appearance (cat and dog), and ability to provide companionship and comfort.
Source: "An important detail regarding these robots is the price picture. The Joy for All models cost approximately €100, while the JustoCat costs approximately €1000, and both are therefore significantly cheaper than other animal robots such as the seal robot Paro (close to €5200). This is arguably a likely reason behind the dominance of these robots."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Practical disadvantages such as hygiene and cost aspects.
Source: "Respondents mentioned some practical disadvantages of introducing robots, such as hygiene and cost aspects."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Decision-makers with broader insight into welfare technology (e.g., social welfare manager, development manager, digitalisation strategist) are more likely to implement robots.
Source: "The survey's descriptive data collection consisted of which municipality the participant belonged to and which professional position the respondent had to ensure that decision-makers with a broader insight into the municipality's welfare technology answered..."

## engagement
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## acceptance
Answer: Widespread acceptance at the municipal level, with more than half of responding municipalities using companionship robots.
Source: "The study shows that the use of companionship robots in care homes for older adults in Sweden is widespread, as more than half of the responding municipalities report having robots."

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: More than half of Swedish municipalities use pet robots for older adults, primarily in dementia care to lower stress and increase safety; pet robots are more common than humanlike robots, likely due to lower cost; use is also found in somatic and short-term care, which are relatively unexplored contexts.
Source: "The study shows that the use of companionship robots in care homes for older adults in Sweden is widespread, as more than half of the responding municipalities report having robots... Something that stands out in the results is the dominance of pet robots (cats and dogs) of the models Joy for All and JustoCat... A somewhat unexpected result in relation to this was the percentage of municipalities that also use robots in homes for somatic care and in short-term care."

## additional_info
Answer: The study only included municipal care homes, not privately managed ones; calls for more in-depth research into motivations for robot purchase and use in less-studied care contexts; notes discrepancy with previous national statistics.
Source: "As the survey was addressed to municipalities, we have not collected data from privately managed care homes." and "We therefore believe that this type of welfare technology deserves wider mapping, studying and follow-up, but nationally and internationally."

## testing_context
Answer: Municipal care homes for older adults in Sweden (including dementia, somatic, psychiatric, disabled, short-term, service house, and adult day-care).
