## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly people want to have more tight connection with society and communicate with younger generation interactively via SNS without using smartphones.
Source: Current services are not enough for elderly people who want to have more tight connection with society. Using the SNS Agency Robot, elderly people can communicate with younger generation interactively via LINE using neither smartphones nor personal computers.

## application_context
Answer: Interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via existing SNS like LINE, installed at elderly people's houses
Source: We propose a SNS Agency Robot that can be used for the interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via existing Social Networking Service (SNS). After setting this robot at an elderly person's house, for example, an elderly person can send a granddaughter a message like "Happy birthday, Hanako! I sent you the present." just by speaking to the SNS Agency Robot.

## testing_context
Answer: House for the elderly with the care service
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016 at the house for the elderly with the care service, named Mon-san Nagasaki in Togitsu-machi, Nagasaki prefecture.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Experiment duration was from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016, with daily interactions
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016 at the house for the elderly with the care service, named Mon-san Nagasaki in Togitsu-machi, Nagasaki prefecture.

## methodology
Answer: Demonstration experiment with prototype system, evaluation of speech recognition accuracy and message destination estimation accuracy
Source: We confirmed the effectiveness of the message destination estimation through the demonstration experiment. We evaluated the speech recognition accuracy that became a premise of the elderly person's message destination estimation method and message destination estimation accuracy.

## robot_type
Answer: Human-type robot
Source: We used PaPeRo, which stands for "Partner-type-Personal-Robot", is a personal robot developed by Japanese firm NEC Corporation. It is noted for its cute appearance and facial recognition system.

## robot_name
Answer: PaPeRo
Source: We used PaPeRo, which stands for "Partner-type-Personal-Robot", is a personal robot developed by Japanese firm NEC Corporation.

## design_goal
Answer: To enable elderly people to communicate via SNS using only voice, without needing to use smartphones or explicitly specify message destinations
Source: Elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via SNS without using smartphones. Our proposed robot is basically operated by voice due to realizing the simple user interface. Therefore, we proposed a message exchange learning-type destination estimation method that enables elderly people not to express a message destination address explicitly.

## robot_general_function
Answer: Voice-based communication via LINE, message destination estimation, speech recognition, message exchange
Source: Elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via SNS without using smartphones. We proposed a message exchange learning-type destination estimation method that enables elderly people not to express a message destination address explicitly.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Voice-based operation simplifies interaction for elderly people, message destination estimation reduces need for explicit addressing, integration with familiar SNS (LINE) enables communication with younger generation
Source: Elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via SNS without using smartphones. Our proposed robot is basically operated by voice due to realizing the simple user interface. Therefore, we proposed a message exchange learning-type destination estimation method that enables elderly people not to express a message destination address explicitly. Younger generation can also communicate with elderly people interactively using their accustomed LINE and smartphones during their spare time.

## key_findings
Answer: The proposed system achieved over 80% message destination estimation accuracy, proving the effectiveness of the message exchange learning-type destination estimation method. The voice-based interface enabled elderly people to communicate via SNS without using smartphones.
Source: In the results of the demonstration experiment, we confirmed that we were able to achieve the message destination estimation probability of more than 80% at the last period of the demonstration experiment. This result proves the effectiveness of our proposed method. Elderly people can communicate with younger generation interactively via LINE using neither smartphones nor personal computers.

## additional_info
Answer: Physical condition of two subjects (87 and 88 years old) turned worse during experiment period, limiting evaluation to one subject (78 years old). System uses external cloud services (Google Speech API, IBM Watson NLC, LINE API) for easy adaptation and low-cost deployment.
Source: Unfortunately, the physical condition of 87 years old man and 88 years old woman turned worse during experiment period. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the communication history of Ms. A. We also re-designed the SNS Agency Robot based on the service-oriented architecture that enables us easily to use open innovation like external cloud-based services. For example, we used Google Cloud Speech API as speech recognition and IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier (NLC) as message destination estimation machine learning engine.
