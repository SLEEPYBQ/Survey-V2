## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Care home residents (older adults, many with dementia), care staff, care home managers, and family members
Source: "The authors would like to sincerely thank the care home managers, staff, residents, and family members who made this study possible... Sixteen care staff became collaborators for the purpose of completing scales and recording observations of residents... care staff observation calendars and end-of-study interviews to understand use, experience, and impact."

## sample_size
Answer: 253 residents had robot interaction opportunities, 83 residents consented for direct data collection, 63 residents included in the final analysis, and 16 care staff collaborators
Source: "In total, 253 residents had robot interaction opportunities, and 83 were consented for direct data collection... Sixteen care staff became collaborators for the purpose of completing scales and recording observations of residents... Twenty of the 83 residents recruited died during the study, leaving 63 participants for analysis (49 females and 14 males)"

## country
Answer: United Kingdom (Cornwall)
Source: "We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial in 8 care homes in Cornwall, United Kingdom."

## age
Answer: Mean age of consented participants was 87.21 years (SD 7.42 years)
Source: "The average age of consented participants was 87.21 years (SD 7.42 years)"

## gender
Answer: 61 females and 22 males among consented residents; 49 females and 14 males among analyzed residents
Source: "The 83 care home residents recruited for directly collected data comprised 61 females and 22 males... leaving 63 participants for analysis (49 females and 14 males)"

## demographic_background
Answer: Residents of rural care homes in Cornwall, UK; included both nursing and residential-only care homes; high prevalence of dementia; no further details on socioeconomic status, education, or technology literacy
Source: "Eight residential care facilities present in rural towns in Cornwall, comprising 4 care homes with nursing care and 4 residential-only care homes... high prevalence of dementia in long-term care facilities, such as care homes"

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Dementia severity measured by Dementia Severity Rating Scale (mean score 32.11, SD 10.52; 0-18 mild, 19-36 moderate, 37-54 severe); residents who interacted had higher dementia severity (mean 33.46) than those who did not (mean 14.73); some residents had reduced mobility or were bed bound
Source: "The average dementia score was 32.11 (SD 10.52)... residents who interacted with robots had significantly higher dementia severity scores... residents who were bed bound (due to mobility or illness), less socially engaged (due to dementia), or in isolation"

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs included entertainment, anxiety and agitation reduction, companionship, alleviating loneliness, and meaningful activity; expectations included realistic design, life-simulation features, and interactivity
Source: "The main reasons recorded in the reason for use of robots were entertainment, anxiety, and agitation... The pets aided in reducing loneliness and providing company and comfort for residents experiencing long periods without visitors or usual excursions... stakeholders commented on hygiene as a design limitation... importance of realistic design, life-simulation features, and interactivity"

## application_context
Answer: Use of affordable robot pets (Joy for All cat and dog) in care homes for older adults, including those with dementia, for improving well-being and reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms
Source: "We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial in 8 care homes... Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia"

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 8-month study; 4-month RCT phase (intervention group received robots, control group care as usual), followed by 4-month qualitative phase (all homes received robots); interaction durations ranged from 15 minutes to 24 hours, with some residents keeping robots day and night; frequency varied, with average interaction length of 3.9 hours
Source: "The study, as conducted... comprised a 4-month, parallel, stratified, cluster RCT... followed by a qualitative study over an additional 4 months, where all 8 care homes received robots... The diaries reported a total of 516.3 hours of interaction with the robots over the 4 months, with an average interaction length of 3.9 hours. The range of interaction lengths varied from 0.25 hours to 24 hours, where residents kept the robot with them all day and night."

## methodology
Answer: Mixed methods: stratified cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with quantitative psychometric scales and qualitative data from staff observation calendars and semistructured interviews
Source: "We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial... Qualitative data were collected through care staff observation calendars and end-of-study interviews... The use of calendars to support interviews and psychometrics allowed for ecologically valid appraisal of subjective experiences"

## care_type
Answer: Psychosocial and emotional care for older adults, including those with dementia, in care homes
Source: "Robot pets may offer a psychosocial method of improving well-being in older adults and people with dementia"

## robot_type
Answer: Animal-like (pet robots: cat and dog)
Source: "Joy for All [JfA] cats and dogs... affordable robot pets"

## robot_name
Answer: Joy for All (JfA) cat and dog
Source: "Joy for All [JfA] cats and dogs... all 8 care homes received 2 JfA devices (1 cat and 1 dog)"

## design_goal
Answer: To provide affordable, acceptable, and effective socially assistive pet robots for improving well-being and reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms in older adults and people with dementia in care homes
Source: "We aimed to address the lack of longer-term real-world research by performing a study with a large sample of care home residents and exploring the effectiveness of affordable robot pets... Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia, including reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness"

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Providing companionship, entertainment, anxiety and agitation reduction, mood improvement, and meaningful activity; facilitating communication and social interaction
Source: "The main reasons recorded in the reason for use of robots were entertainment, anxiety, and agitation... robots encouraged communication, mediating social connection... The pets aided in reducing loneliness and providing company and comfort"

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Realistic design, life-simulation features (e.g., purring, heartbeat), interactivity, mute option, calming effect, ability to provide companionship and meaningful activity, suitability for individual use, and permanent availability of multiple devices
Source: "Participants again supported the importance of realistic design, life-simulation features, and interactivity... importance of mute options (which the JfA devices have) was highlighted... robots were calming, reduced anxiety, improved mood, relaxed residents, reduced agitation, and provided reassurance... The pets were highly valuable tools during the pandemic and lockdowns... The findings also support a no novelty effect for affordable robot pets and suggest that the best practice is the permanent availability of multiple devices"

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Hygiene and cleaning challenges, occasional device breakage, limited appeal for some residents, potential for jealousy or possessiveness, and some negative reactions (dislike, rejection, infantilizing)
Source: "stakeholders commented on hygiene as a design limitation of current devices, requesting removable shells for easier cleaning... this study reported cases of breakage... The finding that almost a quarter of the residents included in the analysis did not interact with the robots indicates that the devices lack universal appeal... issues in sharing and jealousies evidenced in our qualitative results... 11 qualitative counts of robot dislike... infantilizing (interviews: 4)"

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher dementia severity, greater communication issues, more challenging behavior, subjective loneliness, reduced mobility, and being less socially engaged
Source: "residents who interacted with the robots had, on average, more severe dementia, communication issues, and challenging behavior... evidence suggested that robots were most enjoyed by and beneficial to older adults who had dementia, and also those who were bed bound (due to mobility or illness), less socially engaged (due to dementia), or in isolation (due to COVID shielding)... subjective loneliness may be a predictive factor in the acceptance and benefit of robot pets"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Mild or no dementia, higher social engagement, preference for human interaction or group activities, disinterest in robots, and some negative perceptions (e.g., infantilizing, dislike)
Source: "residents who did not interact were considered to have mild dementia (0-18)... residents who were disinterested in the robots were more socially engaged, preferring to play games and socialize with other people... 11 qualitative counts of robot dislike... infantilizing (interviews: 4)"

## engagement
Answer: High engagement; robots were well adopted, with some residents using them day and night; no novelty effect observed over 8 months; 74% of analyzed residents interacted with robots
Source: "robots had high levels of use, and were clearly well adopted into daily practice... The study demonstrated no novelty effect for devices over 8 months... 74% of residents included in the analysis interacted with the robots"

## acceptance
Answer: Good acceptability; 85% of residents who interacted with robots experienced a positive impact; JfA devices seem more generally acceptable than Paro; not universally accepted (about a quarter did not interact)
Source: "the summative impact question demonstrated that, encouragingly, 85% of residents who interacted with the robots experienced a positive impact... the JfA devices seem more generally acceptable... almost a quarter of the residents included in the analysis did not interact with the robots indicates that the devices lack universal appeal"

## trust
Answer: Trust is not directly measured, but high adoption, positive impact, and sustained use without novelty effect suggest development of trust among users
Source: "Evidence strongly supported good robot adoption into services, and usually by particular 'adoptee' residents... The study demonstrated no novelty effect for devices over 8 months"

## key_findings
Answer: Affordable robot pets (JfA cat and dog) improved well-being of care home residents, reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, delusions, elation, anxiety, apathy) and occupational disruptiveness; high adoption and acceptability, especially among residents with more severe dementia and those experiencing loneliness; no novelty effect; qualitative evidence of mood improvement, companionship, and meaningful activity; not universally appealing
Source: "Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia, including reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness... most residents (46/54, 85%) who interacted with robots experienced a positive impact... interactions were more common among residents with more moderate/severe dementia and those subjectively lonely... This work also suggests that robot use impacted occupational disruptiveness, as an indicator of care provider burden... The findings also support a no novelty effect for affordable robot pets and suggest that the best practice is the permanent availability of multiple devices... the devices lack universal appeal"

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include lack of quantitative loneliness data, inability to collect medication records, potential positive reporting bias, inability to blind collaborators, and cluster RCT design; strengths include pragmatic mixed-method approach and ecological validity; COVID-19 pandemic affected study procedures and robot use
Source: "One limitation of this work is the lack of participant responses to the loneliness measure... We had also originally intended to collect medication records, but due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, this was not possible... there is some possibility of positive reporting bias from our collaborators... the inability to blind collaborators to conditions... The use of a cluster RCT may also be perceived as a limitation over standard RCTs... A strength of this work is the pragmatic mixed-method approach... COVID-19 pandemic, resultant care home lock downs, staff workloads, and resident deaths meant that we were unable to carry out the RCT as originally planned"
