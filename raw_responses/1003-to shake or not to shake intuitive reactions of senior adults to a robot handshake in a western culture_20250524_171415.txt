================================================================================

## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Senior adults aged 65+, researchers, and caregivers
Source: Four male and six female senior adults were recruited and participated in this pilot study.

## sample_size
Answer: 10 senior adults
Source: Four male and six female senior adults were recruited and participated in this pilot study.

## country
Answer: Norway
Source: This study was conducted at an elderly activity center in southeast Norway.

## age
Answer: Mean age 85 (SD = 7.27), range 73-96
Source: The mean age of recruited participants was 85 (SD = 7.27).

## gender
Answer: 4 male, 6 female
Source: Four male and six female senior adults were recruited and participated in this pilot study.

## demographic_background
Answer: Independent senior adults able to communicate in Norwegian, no prior robot interaction experience
Source: The inclusion criteria for the study were: a) they should be older than 65 years. b) The participants should be able to communicate in Norwegian; c) they should be independent and able to make their own decisions; and d) they should have no prior experience interacting with robots.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Participants excluded if showing signs of neurological disorders like dementia; one participant mentioned physical disability in hand
Source: Participants were excluded from the study if they had signs of neurological disorders such as dementia. Another participant stated that they were unsure if they were physically able to touch the robot due to a physical disability in their hand.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for intuitive robot behavior, fear reduction, and improved gripper design
Source: By designing the gripper and the robot itself in a more familiar, less fear-eliciting way, senior adults might understand the gesture of shaking hands more intuitively.

## application_context
Answer: Domestic environment for elderly care
Source: Robots have the potential to provide everyday life care and support for senior adults, but acceptance is essential for successful implementation in the domestic environment.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: First encounter, single session lasting 45-60 minutes (handshake part 10-15 minutes)
Source: The overall study lasted about 45–60 minutes for each participant. The greeting element of the study lasted a maximum of 4 minutes, followed by 10-15 minutes of questioning.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative field study using video observations and semi-structured interviews
Source: We conducted a qualitative field study using video observations and semi-structured interviews to measure the senior adults' intuitive reaction, understanding, and experience after being approached to shake hands with a robot.

## care_type
Answer: Social care and support
Source: Socially Assistive Robots (SAR), considered welfare technology, can be a solution to supporting this population and their caregivers.

## robot_type
Answer: Mobile manipulator robot
Source: The TIAGo robot [27] (shown in Fig. 2) would welcome the participant and introduce itself to the user.

## robot_name
Answer: TIAGo
Source: The TIAGo robot [27] (shown in Fig. 2) would welcome the participant and introduce itself to the user.

## design_goal
Answer: Create intuitive nonverbal robot behavior for ease of interaction and adoption
Source: Creating nonverbal robot behavior that is intuitively understandable by humans is vital for the ease of interaction and, therefore, its adoption in everyday life.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Handshake initiation and interaction
Source: The interaction would start with the robot saying: "Welcome to the activity. What is your name? (Answer participants.) Nice to meet you, [name participant]". After this verbal interaction, the robot would reach out its arm to the user and navigate closer to them at a slow movement speed so they could shake the robot's end effector.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Approaching behavior, reaching out arm, movement of arm/hand, face position, gripper position
Source: Those features are the approaching behavior of the robot (2), the reaching out of the arm and hand (5), and the movement of the arm and hand (2). Other mentioned features are the position of the face (1) and the position of the gripper (1).

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Mechanical gripper design, fear-eliciting appearance
Source: Participants also had some suggestions for improving the experience of shaking hands. A small majority of the participants (6) argued that the robot should have a more human-like, less mechanical hand with (flexible) fingers.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Familiarity with robot behavior, understanding of social cues
Source: The participants who self-initiated the handshake understood the robot's movement. "I understood that it wanted something, taking my hand, and that is what I did." (P3).

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Fear of robot, lack of understanding, physical disability
Source: Participants who did not want to shake hands mentioned fear of the robot. Another participant stated that they were unsure if the robot wanted to say "Hi" and whether they were physically able to touch the robot due to a physical disability in their hand.

## engagement
Answer: Varied responses: self-initiated handshake (3), encouraged handshake (5), rejection (2)
Source: Three participants initiated a handshake response, and five needed encouragement to shake hands with the robots. Lastly, two participants refused to shake hands with the robot.

## acceptance
Answer: Mixed acceptance due to fear or lack of understanding
Source: Participants who did not want to shake hands mentioned fear of the robot. Another participant stated that they were unsure if the robot wanted to say "Hi" and whether they were physically able to touch the robot due to a physical disability in their hand.

## trust
Answer: Some participants trusted the robot enough to shake hands, others did not due to fear
Source: One participant who rejected the robot's handshake did not want anything to do with the robot and was afraid. "I thought he wanted to hit me. It is a thing for me. It is a machine that I refuse to call a name." (P7).

## key_findings
Answer: Some participants intuitively understood handshake, others needed encouragement or rejected due to fear/lack of understanding. No significant effect of initial response on reaction time/handshake duration.
Source: Our findings suggest that three out of the ten participants intuitively understood from the social context that they could shake hands with the robots. The participants who did not intuitively understand to shake hands either did not understand the robot or its intentions. Lastly, the ANOVA indicated no significant effect of the initial reaction to the hand offering on the handshake duration.

## additional_info
Answer: Small sample size, limited visibility of participant faces in videos, cultural limitations (Western context), potential observer effect
Source: A limitation of the study is, firstly, the relatively small sample size. A second limitation is the need for more visibility of the faces of the users in the video material. A third limitation is that the findings of this study might be limited to Western culture. A fourth limitation could be that the participants felt like they were being observed.

## testing_context
Answer: Elderly activity center in southeast Norway
Source: This study was conducted at an elderly activity center in southeast Norway. The activity space was the location of the experiments inside the facility.
