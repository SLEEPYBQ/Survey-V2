## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, caregivers, and robotics experts
Source: "18 users' homes for 21 days each to increase the safety of the user by providing fall-detection and prevention."

## sample_size
Answer: 18 users in the first long-term study, 38 users in the Wizard-of-Oz study
Source: "we placed 5 autonomous service robots in 18 users' homes for 21 days each" and "38 users were invited to work as dyads"

## country

## demographic_background
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Users need reliable robot functionality and adaptive autonomy to assist in failure situations
Source: "the expectations of high reliability are not delivered from the robot, it can lead to a degrading perceived intelligence of the robot"

## application_context
Answer: Domestic environments, particularly for elderly care
Source: "Robots in domestic environments" and "in the usecase as care robot for elderly"

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Long-term deployment over 21 days
Source: "we placed 5 autonomous service robots in 18 users' homes for 21 days each"

## methodology
Answer: Long-term field trials and Wizard-of-Oz study
Source: "we placed 5 autonomous service robots in 18 users' homes for 21 days each" and "we carried out a Wizard-of-Oz study"

## care_type
Answer: Elderly care, including fall-detection and prevention
Source: "increase the safety of the user by providing fall-detection and prevention"

## robot_type
Answer: Autonomous service robot
Source: "we placed 5 autonomous service robots in 18 users' homes"

## robot_name
Answer: Pepper (mentioned in related work)
Source: "systems such as Pepper show great potential"

## design_goal
Answer: To develop a shared autonomy behavior coordination system for long-term HRI
Source: "the aim of this work is therefore to realize such system by developing a shared autonomy behavior coordination system"

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Fall-detection, prevention, fetch-and-carry objects, fitness exercise
Source: "increase the safety of the user by providing fall-detection and prevention" and "15 different scenarios (e.g. learn an object with the help of the user, fetch-and-carry objects, fitness exercise)"

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Adaptive behavior components, sliding autonomy levels
Source: "adaptive behavior components, which modified the active states to adjust to the user's preference" and "sliding levels of robot autonomy"

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Lack of understanding of robot's inner state and intended behavior
Source: "the users had difficulties understanding the inner state and intended behavior of the robot"

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Willingness to help the robot during malfunctions
Source: "the malfunctions did not negatively impact the perceived intelligence and likability ratings when the participants were able to solve the occurring issues"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## engagement
Answer: Users showed similar behavior to a clearly malfunctioning robot
Source: "observed similar behavior of the users to a clearly malfunctioning robot as Salem et.al."

## acceptance
Answer: No negative impact on perceived intelligence and likability when users could solve issues
Source: "the malfunctions did not negatively impact the perceived intelligence and likability ratings when the participants were able to solve the occurring issues"

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Robots with adaptive autonomy and error handling do not negatively impact perceived intelligence and likability for long-term HRI
Source: "robots that offer dynamically changing levels of autonomy and mitigation strategies in error situations do not negatively impact perceived intelligence and likability ratings for long-term HRI"

## additional_info
Answer: Future work includes exploring attentive behavior coordination to increase perceived intelligence
Source: "In a future study, we seek to explore in which situations the robot needs to provide such an attentive behavior coordination"

## testing_context
Answer: Users' homes
Source: "we placed 5 autonomous service robots in 18 users' homes for 21 days each"
