## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals with developmental disabilities, caregivers, and robotics developers
Source: "Aether™, a SAR co-designed with the Developmental Disabilities Association (DDA), Vancouver, Canada. Aether™was created to alleviate the burden of care on caregivers and to provide a higher level of autonomy to seniors and people with DD."

## demographic_background
Answer: People with developmental disabilities and caregivers in long-term care facilities
Source: "Long-term care for people with developmental disabilities (DD) requires personalized care to address this population's high variability, resulting in multiple challenges due to their physical and cognitive health."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Developmental disabilities, including physical and cognitive health challenges
Source: "Long-term care for people with developmental disabilities (DD) requires personalized care to address this population's high variability, resulting in multiple challenges due to their physical and cognitive health."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Alleviating caregiver burden and providing autonomy to seniors and people with DD
Source: "Aether™was created to alleviate the burden of care on caregivers and to provide a higher level of autonomy to seniors and people with DD."

## application_context
Answer: Long-term care facilities for safety inspection and entertainment activities
Source: "safety inspection, where the robot inspects the rooms of an LTCF to find safety hazards (e.g., blocked passage-ways, open doors, and tripping hazards) or fallen people; and entertainment, where the robot partakes in cognitive stimulation activities, such as karaoke sessions, trivia games or bingo."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Development of a VR simulator using game technologies and digital twins
Source: "This paper presents the use of game technologies to develop a Virtual reality digital twin simulator for overcoming the lack of access to LTCFs and the elderly by creating synthetic data that simulates the robot's behavior, interactions with the environment, and virtual avatars, before its deployment."

## care_type
Answer: Long-term care for people with developmental disabilities
Source: "Long-term care for people with developmental disabilities (DD) requires personalized care to address this population's high variability, resulting in multiple challenges due to their physical and cognitive health."

## robot_type
Answer: Socially assistive robot
Source: "Aether™, a SAR co-designed with the Developmental Disabilities Association (DDA), Vancouver, Canada."

## robot_name
Answer: Aether™
Source: "Aether™, a SAR co-designed with the Developmental Disabilities Association (DDA), Vancouver, Canada."

## design_goal
Answer: To alleviate caregiver burden and provide autonomy to seniors and people with DD
Source: "Aether™was created to alleviate the burden of care on caregivers and to provide a higher level of autonomy to seniors and people with DD."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Safety inspection and entertainment activities
Source: "safety inspection, where the robot inspects the rooms of an LTCF to find safety hazards (e.g., blocked passage-ways, open doors, and tripping hazards) or fallen people; and entertainment, where the robot partakes in cognitive stimulation activities, such as karaoke sessions, trivia games or bingo."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Navigation, person detection, and inspection behavior
Source: "Our preliminary results allowed us to test and compare the robot navigation, test the person detection, and develop the inspection behavior."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Uncanny animations and avatar behavior
Source: "we identified challenges regarding presence due to uncanny animations and avatar behavior that are distracting."

## key_findings
Answer: Combining digital twins and VR expedites robot development and allows testing despite COVID-19 restrictions
Source: "Our preliminary results indicate that combining DTs and VR expedites robot development. We tested and compared the robot navigation, person detection, and inspection behavior while observing COVID-19 restrictions."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include uncanny animations and avatar behavior
Source: "we identified challenges regarding presence due to uncanny animations and avatar behavior that are distracting."

## testing_context
Answer: Virtual reality simulator and long-term care facility replicas
Source: "The DT VR simulation comprises four replicas, two fully furnished navigation scenarios, one based on the office space at JDQ and another based on one of DDA's LTCF; the virtual Aether™SAR, and virtual avatars of staff and residents."
