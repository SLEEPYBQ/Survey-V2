## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Needs: Increased independence, improved social relationships, perceived safety. Expectations: Reduced need for caregiver presence, improved contacts, support in emergencies.  
Source: "The social rationale behind this choice came from an exploratory phase conducted with four Tuscan social cooperatives in which the social workers and directors were interviewed. The results a strong need to support the social workers and improve the socialization and the monitoring of people included in the domiciliary assistive program."  

## application_context  
Answer: Supporting frail elderly in their homes to live independently and improve social relationships.  
Source: "In this context, a robotic telepresence service could support the frail persons in their homes, empowering their social relationships."  

## testing_context  
Answer: Private homes  
Source: "The proposed protocol is divided into three main phases as depicted in Figure 1. In the first part of the experimental protocol, the engineers trained the social workers to the use of the Double robot and to install it in a private home."  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: Long-term deployment (169 days), average duration of a single service was 29 mins for a total of 2871 mins of usage.  
Source: "At the end of the field trials, which lasted 169 days in total, a total of 105 telepresence services were delivered. The average duration of a single service was equal to 29 mins for a total of 2871 mins of usage."  

## methodology  
Answer: Multidimensional questionnaires (acceptance, usability, expectation domains), qualitative and quantitative analysis.  
Source: "A total of 169 days of field-test trial was evaluated before (TO) and after (TF) the tests with a multidimensional framework, including acceptance, usability, and expectation domains."  

## robot_type  
Answer: Telepresence robot  
Source: "In this work, 10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot (i.e. Double Robot)."  

## robot_name  
Answer: Double Robot  
Source: "In this work, 10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot (i.e. Double Robot)."  

## design_goal  
Answer: To support frail elderly in their homes, empowering their social relationships.  
Source: "In this context, a robotic telepresence service could support the frail persons in their homes, empowering their social relationships."  

## robot_general_function  
Answer: Remote telepresence service for social interaction with caregivers.  
Source: "The proposed service allowed the social workers to remote visit the frail seniors at their home, increasing the total number of visits performed in a week."  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Improved social interaction, increased independence, perceived safety, ease of use.  
Source: "The proposed service allowed the social workers to remote visit the frail seniors at their home, increasing the total number of visits performed in a week."  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Privacy concerns, fear of the robot, perceived difficulty in communication.  
Source: "Subjects who expected the robot negatively affects their privacy (expectation item 1), their independence (expectation item 6), and their safety (PES) felt also more embarrassed (ANX-Q4) and nervous (ANX-Q5) using the robot."  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Positive attitude towards technology, higher trust in robot's ability, enjoyment in using the robot.  
Source: "A positive *a priori* attitude is related to more trust towards the robot, more enjoyment in using it, and with the idea that the robot is easy to use."  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Negative bias, fear of the robot, anxiety during interaction.  
Source: "Negative bias towards the robot (i.e. to be afraid of the robot) could increase the subjects' anxiety and the tension during the interaction."  

## engagement  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## acceptance  
Answer: Average score of 70.83 at TF for ad-hoc questionnaire (usability and acceptance domains).  
Source: "The mean overall score for the ad-hoc questionnaires (12 items) was 61.17 (SD=12.30) at T0 and 70.83 (SD=9.79) at TF."  

## robot_function_effectiveness  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## user_satisfaction  
Answer: Positive trend in enjoyment (ENJ-Q6) and trust (TRUST-Q7) after use.  
Source: "After using the robot, people declare to enjoy more than they expected [7]."  

## user_curiosity  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## user_trust_reliance  
Answer: Higher trust scores after use (TRUST-Q7).  
Source: "The TRUST subscale shows an interesting pattern. These data encourage to believe that making real experience with the robot could foster the trust, and increase the perceived comfort during the interaction."  

## user_understanding  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## learning_curve_productivity  
Answer: Perceived ease of use improved after use (PEU-Q11).  
Source: "The Wilcoxon test for paired samples on ad-hoc questionnaires show us statistically significant differences between item 11 (the interface usability) at T0 and TF."  

## system_controllability_interaction  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## key_findings  
Answer: Expectations influence usability and acceptance; real experience improves trust and perceived ease of use; positive attitude correlates with higher trust and enjoyment.  
Source: "Expectation and prejudice seem to play a key role, not only in determining the perceived usability/acceptance of a robot but also concerning the real usability and acceptance after the interaction with the robot."  

## additional_info  
Answer: Limitations include small sample size and lack of demographic influence analysis.  
Source: "Based on our small sample, it seems that there is no relationship between gender, age, educational level, and family composition in any measurements."
