## gender
Answer: N/A

## demographic_background
Answer: Professional caregivers from various care institutions in northern Germany; 22 right-handed, 2 left-handed; 14 had limited visual abilities; 6 had prior joystick experience; most spent little working time at the PC (mean 2.87 h, median 2.25 h)
Source: "Twenty-two of the subjects were right-handed and two left-handed. More than half (14) had limited visual abilities and six subjects were familiar with the use of joysticks, PC game control, or remote control of drones or cars. Most of the test persons spend little working time at the PC (mean 2.87 h, median 2.25 h)."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Nurses desired access to the technology, found it helpful for daily tasks, and believed it brought more advantages than disadvantages. They envisioned applications like patient transfer/mobilization, food/drink intake, hygiene, wound documentation, and moving objects.
Source: "The question of whether the subjects wanted access to this technology was answered positively... The statement that this technology would help to do their daily tasks more comfortably is rated higher than 4 on the same scale... the subjects agree with the statement that this technology would bring them more advantages than disadvantages... Patient Transfer/Mobilization, Food and drink intake, Hygiene and body care, Wound documentation, Moving objects or devices."

## application_context
Answer: Outpatient care, specifically for tasks like handing objects to patients and examining body parts remotely
Source: "One potential use case is outpatient care, which nowadays involves traveling long distances. Here, the use of telerobotics could provide a major relief for the nursing staff... Tasks common in outpatient care, such as handing out things (manipulation) and examining body parts (set camera view), were used in the study."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use with two rounds of tasks; each task had a maximum of 5 minutes
Source: "Then the two tasks were carried out, for which the subject had a maximum of 5 min... The study was then conducted in two rounds."

## methodology
Answer: Laboratory study with within-subject design; quantitative metrics (execution times, SUS, NASA-TLX) and qualitative assessments (questionnaires)
Source: "We conducted the investigations in a laboratory study... The study bases on a within-subject design... the usability with the SUS value and the load with the NASA-TLX of the two input devices... qualitative evaluation of the question, which application possibilities the nursing staff can imagine for this technology."

## care_type
Answer: Outpatient care
Source: "One potential use case is outpatient care, which nowadays involves traveling long distances."

## robot_type
Answer: 7-degree-of-freedom manipulator (Franka Emika Panda) with a camera mounted on the end effector
Source: "the manipulator used has joints with limits... The Franka Emika Panda represents the Manipulator. This is a 7-degree of freedom manipulator with force-torque sensors in each joint."

## robot_name
Answer: Franka Emika Panda
Source: "The Franka Emika Panda represents the Manipulator."

## design_goal
Answer: To relieve nursing staff by reducing unnecessary trips to patients; support formal and informal caregivers in outpatient care centered around the bed
Source: "The aim of our research is to relieve the strain on nursing staff... The design of our teleoperation system derives from the needs of care. It focuses on the support of formal and informal caregivers in outpatient care centered around the bed."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Telemanipulation for tasks like handing objects and setting camera views; controlled via input devices (Novint Falcon 3D Haptic Controller and keyboard/mouse)
Source: "Tasks common in outpatient care, such as handing out things (manipulation) and examining body parts (set camera view), were used in the study... We select the Novint Falcon 3D Haptic Controller and Keyboard together with a mouse as input devices."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Shorter execution times with Novint Falcon; usability rated "O.K."; positive acceptance and perceived helpfulness
Source: "the Novint Falcon 3D Haptic Controller showed to be the best in terms of execution time... the usability is only 'O.K.'... the nursing staff desire and could accept the described telemanipulation system."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Difficulty in adjusting camera orientation; loss of target visibility increased execution time; no difference in usability/load between input devices
Source: "the subjects have the greatest difficulty in positioning the camera vertically above the target... the execution time and the distance traveled is longer if the target is lost sight of... no difference compared to keyboard and mouse in usability and load was evident."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Prior joystick experience correlated with better usability ratings; no age dependency on acceptance
Source: "The usability of the input devices (mean of both) is rated better by the test persons with joystick experience... Contrary to expectations, technology acceptance and readiness do not decrease with age."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Increased PC working time correlated with lower usability ratings for keyboard/mouse
Source: "the keyboard and mouse are used completely differently in the daily work of the nursing staff than was necessary here. This habituation may have made it more difficult for these subjects to learn the new way of using them."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement with 96% task completion rate; positive qualitative feedback on usefulness
Source: "All 25 subjects had individual appointments and tested both control systems... 192 of which were successful (96%)... the nursing staff desire and could accept the described telemanipulation system."

## acceptance
Answer: Positive acceptance; subjects wanted access to the technology and predicted they would use it
Source: "the nursing staff desire and could accept the described telemanipulation system... the question of whether the subjects wanted access to this technology was answered positively... Given that I have access to the system, I predict that I would use it."

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Nurses could control the telemanipulator after short training; Novint Falcon had shorter execution times but no difference in usability/load; system was economically viable and well-accepted; orientation control was challenging
Source: "the nursing staff can operate it... the Novint Falcon 3D Haptic Controller showed to be the best in terms of execution time... no difference compared to keyboard and mouse in usability and load was evident... telemanipulation makes economic sense... the subjects have the greatest difficulty in positioning the camera vertically above the target."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include restricted workspace, lack of tactile feedback, and network latency considerations; future work will focus on semi-automation and augmented reality
Source: "The teleoperation system presented in this work has also several limitations... In future work, we will improve the control system toward a semi-automatic system and compare this with the results achieved here."

## testing_context
Answer: Laboratory study in a realistic replica of a senior apartment (IDEAAL apartment) and a remote care service center
Source: "The experiments are performed in the IDEAAL apartment in Oldenburg, Germany. This is a realistic replica of a typical senior apartment and thus forms a familiar environment for the nursing staff."
