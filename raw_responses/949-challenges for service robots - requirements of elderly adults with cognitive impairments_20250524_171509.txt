## age
Answer: Potential users aged between 55 and 90 years
Source: "The potential user group included persons aged between 55 and 90 years with MCI or early stages of AD defined by MMSE score of 20–26 points."

## gender
Answer: Majority of respondents were women (at least 2/3)
Source: "At least 2/3 of respondents were women."

## demographic_background
Answer: Education levels included elementary, secondary, and higher education. Positive attitude toward new technologies was noted.
Source: "Education level: Higher (1), Elementary (2), Elementary (6), Higher (3)... Positive attitude toward new technologies: 81.01%."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Participants had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with MMSE scores of 20–26.
Source: "The potential user group included persons aged between 55 and 90 years with MCI or early stages of AD defined by MMSE score of 20–26 points."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: High priority needs included emergency response (calling for help, detecting obstacles), medication reminders, and safety reminders (boiling water, turning off gas/lights).
Source: "High level priority functional requirements were related to reacting in emergency situations (calling for help, detecting/removing obstacles) and to reminding about medication intake, about boiling water, turning off the gas and lights (almost 60% of answers)."

## application_context
Answer: Home care for elderly adults with cognitive impairments to support independent living.
Source: "The aim of the project is to create a robot that might support older adults with MCI living independently at home."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Focus groups and surveys (Likert scale and frequency analysis)
Source: "Based on focus groups performed in two centers (Poland and Spain), we created surveys for medical staff, patients, and caregivers... Using Likert scale and analysis made on the basis of the frequency of survey responses..."

## care_type
Answer: Home care for elderly with cognitive impairments
Source: "The aim of the project is to create a robot that might support older adults with MCI living independently at home."

## robot_type
Answer: Robotic assistant (anthropomorphic appearance preferred)
Source: "The majority of the respondents would like a robotic assistant to have an anthropomorphic appearance (woman or neutral)..."

## robot_name
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## design_goal
Answer: To support older adults with cognitive impairments in independent living by addressing safety, medication reminders, and emergency response.
Source: "The aim of the project is to create a robot that might support older adults with MCI living independently at home."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Emergency response, medication reminders, safety reminders, cognitive exercises, and human-robot interaction (voice commands).
Source: "High level priority functional requirements were related to reacting in emergency situations... and to reminding about medication intake... With reference to human–robot interaction, high priority was given to voice operated system..."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Voice-operated system, emergency response, medication reminders, and safety reminders (enhance safety and independence).
Source: "High level priority functional requirements were related to reacting in emergency situations... and to reminding about medication intake... With reference to human–robot interaction, high priority was given to voice operated system..."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Positive attitude toward new technologies and willingness to accept robotic assistance.
Source: "Positive attitude toward new technologies: 81.01%."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## engagement
Answer: High engagement noted, with 80% of respondents accepting robotic assistants.
Source: "Over 80% of the respondents accept robotic assistants as a way to remain healthy and safe in their own homes."

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance, with 80% of respondents agreeing to robotic assistance.
Source: "Over 80% of the respondents accept robotic assistants as a way to remain healthy and safe in their own homes."

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development, with 69% of potential users and 84% of caregivers needing 3–4 training sessions before trusting the robot.
Source: "Almost 70% cognitively impaired respondents and almost 84% of caregivers expressed the need to attend training sessions (minimum 3–4 training sessions) before they agree to leave the users alone with a robotic assistant."

## key_findings
Answer: High priority needs include emergency response, medication reminders, and safety reminders. Voice-operated interaction was preferred. High acceptance of robotic assistants among stakeholders.
Source: "High level priority functional requirements were related to reacting in emergency situations... and to reminding about medication intake... With reference to human–robot interaction, high priority was given to voice operated system... Over 80% of the respondents accept robotic assistants..."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include conceptual perception of the robot rather than actual use. Cultural differences between Polish and Spanish respondents were noted.
Source: "The main limitation of this study lies in the conceptual perception of an assistive robot rather than actual use... Cultural differences between Polish and Spanish respondents were noted."

## testing_context
Answer: Surveys conducted in medical centers (Medical University of Lublin and Fundació ACE).
Source: "The survey questionnaires were sourced from two autonomic centers: Medical University of Lublin (LUM) and Fundació ACE (ACE)."
