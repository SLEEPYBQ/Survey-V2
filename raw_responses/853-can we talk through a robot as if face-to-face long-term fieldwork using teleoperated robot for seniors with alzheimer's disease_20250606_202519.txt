## gender
Answer: All female

## demographic_background
Answer: Residents with Alzheimer's disease living in a group home; university students majoring in gerontology
Source: "Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study. They were all clinically diagnosed as AD." and "We recruited five university students who major in gerontology as evaluators."

## technology_literacy
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Cognitive impairments: Alzheimer's disease (MMSE scores: 0-17); Physical impairments: Not explicitly mentioned
Source: "They were all clinically diagnosed as AD." and "Her MMSE score was 0" and "Her MMSE scores were 17 (before) and 14 (after)."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs: Communication support for seniors with dementia; Expectations: Positive reactions to Telenoid, improved communication
Source: "We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors." and "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## application_context
Answer: Elderly care facilities, long-term communication support
Source: "We discuss the possibilities of using Telenoid as a tool to support long-term communication between people and elderly individuals."

## testing_context
Answer: Group home for seniors with dementia
Source: "The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months in a group home for seniors with dementia in Osaka, Japan."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 10 trials per participant, each trial lasted approximately 15 minutes
Source: "We conducted 10 trials (interactions) for each participant. The average duration of an interaction was 709.1 s (SD = 316.2) for the Face condition and 798.7 s (SD = 383.3) for the Telenoid condition."

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, video analysis, questionnaires
Source: "From the video recordings, we counted the number of times that the participants used body gestures and made physical contact." and "The speaker and the observer filled out the following questionnaire, where each item was rated on a five-point scale."

## robot_type
Answer: Teleoperated robot with child-like appearance
Source: "Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice."

## robot_name
Answer: Telenoid R3b
Source: "Telenoid R3b (Figure 1)."

## design_goal
Answer: To provide communication support for seniors with dementia
Source: "We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors."

## robot_general_function
Answer: Transmits remote operator's movements and voice, allows physical interaction
Source: "Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice. Telenoid users can physically interact (hug and touch) with the robot while communicating with an operator who can communicate from a remote place through the Internet."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Physical interaction (hugging, touching), child-like appearance, remote operation
Source: "Telenoid users can physically interact (hug and touch) with the robot while communicating with an operator who can communicate from a remote place through the Internet." and "The small and soft body of Telenoid allows people to hold it while having conversation through it."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited non-verbal communication, difficulty in understanding severe dementia patients
Source: "Non-verbal information, like holding hands and eye contact, is important, but communicating this through Telenoid was difficult."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Positive reaction to child-like appearance, less nervousness in communication
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid. Both became less nervous while communicating with Telenoid from the time they were first introduced to it."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe dementia, difficulty in verbal communication
Source: "Ms. C was diagnosed as AD in 2004. Her MMSE score was 0, indicating severe dementia. She tended to make ambiguous statements and repeat the same phrases. Verbal communication was difficult with her."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement with Telenoid, more physical interactions
Source: "They started to use more body gestures in the face-to-face condition and more physical interactions in the Telenoid-mediated condition."

## acceptance
Answer: Positive acceptance of Telenoid by two residents with moderate AD
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## robot_function_effectiveness
Answer: Effective in facilitating communication for moderate AD, less effective for severe AD
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid." and "Ms. C was diagnosed as AD in 2004. Her MMSE score was 0, indicating severe dementia. She tended to make ambiguous statements and repeat the same phrases. Verbal communication was difficult with her."

## user_satisfaction
Answer: Higher satisfaction in Telenoid condition for moderate AD
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## user_curiosity

## system_controllability_interaction
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Telenoid can motivate residents with moderate AD to communicate, supports non-verbal communication for severe AD
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid." and "Thus, we conclude that Telenoid may trigger positive emotions in residents with moderate AD and suggest the possibilities of non-verbal communication with residents with severe AD as well."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include lack of comparison with other robots and potential cross-effects between conditions
Source: "Another limitation of the current study lies in that its results do not show the effect of using Telenoid in comparison with other robots." and "The experiment did not prove the effect of Telenoid itself, since the speakers had conversations both with Telenoid and face-to-face."
