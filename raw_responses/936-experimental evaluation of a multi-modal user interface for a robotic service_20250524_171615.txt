================================================================================

## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals aged 70–89, researchers
Source: Fifteen participants, aged between 70 and 89 years old, were invited to interact with a robotic platform

## sample_size
Answer: 15 elderly participants
Source: A total of 15 subjects (3 males, 12 females, all native British English speakers) from Wesley Court have participated in the experiments.

## country
Answer: United Kingdom
Source: To recruit participants we held a workshop at a sheltered housing facility for the accommodation of retired people in Plymouth, United Kingdom.

## age
Answer: 70–89 years old, average 80.53
Source: Participants' age was in the range 70–89, average 80.53

## gender
Answer: 3 males, 12 females
Source: A total of 15 subjects (3 males, 12 females, all native British English speakers)

## demographic_background
Answer: Well-educated, higher or further education degrees, including 4 engineers; 6 use a computer, 8 know how to use a computer, 10 never used a smartphone, 8 regularly use a tablet, 3 know how to use a tablet
Source: they were all well educated, with higher or further education degrees, including 4 engineers. Almost all use (6) or know how to use (8) a computer, majority (10) never used a smartphone but Eight regularly use a tablet and Three know how to use it.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: One participant had severe visual impairment
Source: she has a severe visual impairment and she didn't have her magnifying glasses during the experiment.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Preference for multi-modal interaction (speech and tablet together), confidence in using speech-only interaction
Source: all participants scored at least 4, with an average score of 4.14, "I like the idea of using speech and tablet together to complete the food delivery service". 

## application_context
Answer: Assistive robotic services for elderly care in everyday living
Source: The MMUI system offers users two main modalities to send commands: they are a GUI, usually running on the tablet attached to the robot, and a SUI, with a wearable microphone on the user.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use, single session lasting 45 minutes
Source: The test for each subject lasted for 45 min.

## methodology
Answer: Quantitative (System Usability Scale, ad-hoc questionnaire) and qualitative (video analysis, open-question interviews) methods
Source: During the experiments, in addition to questionnaires and open-question interview opinions, frontal and profile video recordings were collected.

## care_type
Answer: Assistive care for elderly, specifically food delivery service
Source: The food delivery service was chosen to be the main task; subjects could use speech, tablet, or both of them to complete the task.

## robot_type
Answer: Customized G5 platform with a tablet and wearable microphone
Source: The robotic platform used in our experiments is shown in Fig. 1. It is a customized G5 platform produced within the Robot-Era project.

## robot_name
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## design_goal
Answer: Enhance usability and acceptability of assistive robot systems for elderly users via multi-modal interaction
Source: The MMUI, which was designed to enhance the user experience in terms of usability and to increase acceptability of assistive robot systems by elderly users

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Food delivery service via GUI (tablet) and SUI (speech)
Source: The MMUI is designed to allow the user to browse three different options: meat, fish and vegetarian (veggie).

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Multi-modal interaction (GUI and SUI), flexible attention switching between modalities
Source: This behaviour suggests that a MMUI facilitates a more personalised and flexible interaction, which is clearly preferred by the elderly participants of our experiment.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Preference for multi-modal interaction, familiarity with tablets
Source: Indeed, 12 participants out of 15, i.e. 80 %, looked at the tablet for more than 50 % of the time in the *Reading menu* step of the experiment.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe visual impairment
Source: she has a severe visual impairment and she didn't have her magnifying glasses during the experiment.

## engagement
Answer: High engagement, preference for SUI but switched to GUI during menu reading
Source: Indeed, 12 participants (80 %) spent the majority of the time (> 50 %) looking at the robot, while just two (13 %) participants preferred to look at the tablet.

## acceptance
Answer: Positive evaluation, SUS score average 80.67
Source: SUS | 80.67 | 80 | 9.04

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Multi-modal interaction enhances usability and acceptability for elderly users, flexible interaction is preferred
Source: This behaviour suggests that a MMUI facilitates a more personalised and flexible interaction, which is clearly preferred by the elderly participants of our experiment.

## additional_info
Answer: Participants enjoyed the experience and offered availability for further studies
Source: all the participants indicated that they enjoyed the experience during the experiments with the robot and many offered their availability for further studies.

## testing_context
Answer: Controlled setting at Plymouth University
Source: Focused experiment in a controlled setting. The elderly participant is sitting in front of the robot, while the tablet is detached and placed on the table easy accessible by the user.
