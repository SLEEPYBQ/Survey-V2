## cognitive_and_physical_impairment  
Answer: MCI diagnosed per European Consortium criteria; MMSE and neuropsychological tests used  
Source: "having received a clinical diagnosis of MCI according to the European Consortium on Alzheimer's Disease Working Group on MCI"  

## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: MCI: cognitive support, companionship; caregivers: safety, caregiver burden reduction; HOA: communication, entertainment  
Source: "Participants acknowledged the potential benefits of SAR for supporting care at home for individuals with cognitive impairment."  

## application_context  
Answer: Home care for older adults with cognitive impairment  
Source: "SAR may help improve care delivery at home for older adults with cognitive impairment and reduce the burden of informal caregivers."  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: Focus groups (1.5–2 h sessions) and surveys; no long-term deployment  
Source: "Sessions lasted between 1.5 and 2 h."  

## methodology  
Answer: Mixed-method (quantitative surveys, qualitative focus groups)  
Source: "Different technology acceptance questions [...] were addressed in a mixed-method study."  

## care_type  
Answer: Dementia care (cognitive and social support)  
Source: "SAR may help improve care delivery at home for older adults with cognitive impairment."  

## robot_type  
Answer: Mechanical human-like, animal-like, machine-like  
Source: "mechanical human-like robot [...] animal-like and machine-like robots"  

## robot_name  
Answer: RobuLAB 10  
Source: "The RobuLAB 10 robot [...] was used for a live demonstration."  

## design_goal  
Answer: Customizable appearance, social capabilities, and services  
Source: "A key theme [...] was the importance of customizing SAR appearance, services, and social capabilities."  

## robot_concern_function  
Answer: Cognitive support, communication, safety monitoring, entertainment  
Source: "cognitive support applications [...] communication services [...] risk prevention and healthcare applications"  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Cognitive support (e.g., task reminding), communication (e.g., video calls), safety (e.g., fall detection)  
Source: "Participants acknowledged the potential benefits of SAR for supporting care at home."  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Usability issues, lack of trust, privacy concerns  
Source: "Mismatch between needs and solutions [...] usability factors [...] lack of experience with technology"  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Higher technology experience, current care needs (MCI/caregivers)  
Source: "caregivers and persons with MCI had a higher perceived usefulness and intention to use SAR"  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Low technology literacy, negative stereotypes (HOA)  
Source: "HOA [...] did not identify themselves as potential users of these systems."  

## engagement  
Answer: Moderate engagement; higher in MCI/caregivers  
Source: "Participants acknowledged the potential benefits of SAR [...] intention to use SAR was found to be lower for the present time than that anticipated for the future."  

## acceptance  
Answer: Lower current intention (mean 0.84/3) vs. future (1.96/3); higher in MCI/caregivers  
Source: "intention to use SAR was found to be lower for the present time than that anticipated for the future."  

## trust  
Answer: Privacy concerns (MCI), safety trust (caregivers)  
Source: "MCI participants were more sensitive to privacy issues [...] caregivers had a more positive perception of [...] risk-prevention applications."  

## key_findings  
Answer: Customization is critical; MCI/caregivers more accepting; future intention higher than current  
Source: "A key theme [...] was the importance of customizing SAR [...] intention to use SAR was found to be lower for the present time than that anticipated for the future."  

## additional_info  
Answer: Small sample size, lack of direct robot interaction  
Source: "Some methodological issues limit the findings of this study. First, there is the small size of the sample."  

## testing_context  
Answer: Focus groups in a lab/meeting setting  
Source: "The day of the meeting, participants read and signed an informed consent form prior to the beginning of the discussion."
