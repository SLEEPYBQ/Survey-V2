## gender
Answer: 11 female, 8 male (final sample: 9 female, 8 male after 2 males withdrew)
Source: "Our workshop involved 19 older adults (11F, 8M, aged 65–74 years with a mean of 67.7 years). Two male participants withdrew during the first session, citing a lack of interest, which resulted in a final sample size of 17 participants."

## demographic_background
Answer: Participants were recruited from Swansea City Council's Ageing Well Society and Age Cymru in Wales, UK; technology interest was measured (mean 3.88 ± 0.9); most had no prior experience with social robots.
Source: "We recruited the participants through email invitations sent via Swansea City Council's Ageing Well Society and Age Cymru, which is the national charity for older people in Wales, UK." and "Participants exhibited relatively high interest in technologies with mean and standard deviations (SD) of 3.88 ± 0.9." and "Three participants reported limited experiences with social robots...The rest fourteen participants had no prior experience."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Some participants mentioned hearing loss and visual impairments; no standardized measurement tools or scores reported.
Source: "our hearing loss increases as we age, so a social robot that provides companionship with a display screen would also help assist the deaf and have speakers and volume control to aid people with visual impairments" [P12, P11].

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs include social connection, emotional support, companionship, tactile interaction, accessibility, and privacy; expectations for animal-like, soft, medium-sized robots with interactive features.
Source: "older adults need social connections since the lack of social interaction during the pandemic has reinforced fear and uncertainty...older adults need emotional support...social robots have the potential to address not only practical needs but also emotional ones by fostering a sense of connection and reducing feelings of isolation and loneliness...desired a companion pet robot that could provide emotional support, enduring companionship, meaningful social interactions and ease of access."

## application_context
Answer: Private and public environments, including home, hospitals, community centers, and public transport
Source: "preferences for social robots in private and public environments" and "Some of the examples of private scenarios were cooking, reading a book or watching TV alone at home or spending time with family members. Some of the examples of public scenarios were hospital appointments, meeting in community centres, group activities and public transport."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: First encounter, single three-hour co-design workshop session
Source: "This workshop lasted three hours, including a 45-minute lunch break. The sessions were run as described below."

## methodology
Answer: Co-design workshop using qualitative and quantitative methods, including thematic analysis, questionnaires, and design preference ratings

## care_type
Answer: Emotional and mental well-being support
Source: "Social robots address emotional challenges post COVID-19 as they represent a promising strategy to support older adults' emotional well-being, promote social connections, and provide physical contact."

## robot_type
Answer: Animal-like, humanoid, and toy-like robots (examples: Miro-E, JoyForAll cat, Vector, JoyForAll dog, Nao)
Source: "we distributed five commercial social robots, i.e., Miro-E, Vector, JoyForAll cat, JoyForAll dog and Nao, see Figs. 3 and 4. This encompassed a humanoid, animal-like and toy-like robot with various feels (soft, hard, furry, etc.), sizes, behaviours and interactions."

## robot_name
Answer: Miro-E, Vector, JoyForAll cat, JoyForAll dog, Nao
Source: "we distributed five commercial social robots, i.e., Miro-E, Vector, JoyForAll cat, JoyForAll dog and Nao, see Figs. 3 and 4."

## design_goal
Answer: To design a social robot that addresses older adults' emotional challenges post-COVID-19, focusing on companionship, emotional support, and user preferences for appearance, feel, size, behavior, and interaction
Source: "The workshop aimed to examine the current emotional challenges experienced by older adults after the COVID-19 pandemic, their preferences towards social robots in different post-pandemic environments, and the design specifications of a social robot that could address these challenges."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Companionship, emotional support, social interaction, tactile interaction, accessibility features (e.g., display, speakers, microphone, camera)
Source: "Participants realised this by adapting the robots' capabilities to their needs, including the potential to help them connect with others, reduce loneliness and anxiety, and address emotional challenges. Consequently, they desired a companion pet robot that could provide emotional support, enduring companionship, meaningful social interactions and ease of access."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Animal-like appearance, soft/furry texture, medium size, dynamic body parts, facial expressions, touch, speakers, microphone, camera, display screen; these features are considered beneficial for providing companionship, emotional support, and accessibility.
Source: "older adults prefer animal-like social robot designs...The feel of the social robot was preferred to be a fur texture and more life-like that can be stroked or petted, reducing anxiety...desired the robot to be medium-sized, more like a pet...most participants preferred a robot with facial expressions...all types of interactions were desired to be incorporated into the robot design showing no significant difference, making it an intuitive companion pet robot."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Humanoid appearance (perceived as "freaky"), hard/rigid feel, toy/abstract robots (do not give a natural feeling), moving around (scared some participants), privacy concerns with display screen, camera, and microphone
Source: "11 participants stated humanoid robots are freaky and six participants claimed that a toy/abstract robot do not give a natural feeling...the social robot's hard rigid feel rated the lowest...few preferred to avoid the robot's moving around as it scared them...a potential privacy issue was raised with incorporating a display screen, camera, and microphone as P17 stated that, 'A display screen may threaten me if I don't know how to use it.'"

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: High interest in technology, willingness to engage in co-design, adaptability, desire for social connection and emotional support
Source: "Participants exhibited relatively high interest in technologies with mean and standard deviations (SD) of 3.88 ± 0.9...eight older adults showed positive feelings as they can adapt to COVID-19 changes...Consequently, older adults specified the social robots' design preferences..."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Limited prior experience with social robots, physical and sensory impairments (e.g., hearing loss, visual impairment), privacy concerns, fear of technology, and being scared by certain robot behaviors (e.g., moving around)
Source: "Three participants reported limited experiences with social robots...our hearing loss increases as we age, so a social robot that provides companionship with a display screen would also help assist the deaf and have speakers and volume control to aid people with visual impairments...a potential privacy issue was raised with incorporating a display screen, camera, and microphone as P17 stated that, 'A display screen may threaten me if I don't know how to use it.'...few preferred to avoid the robot's moving around as it scared them."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement in co-design activities; participants actively explored, discussed, and designed social robots
Source: "The facilitators helped the participants to discover various features of the robots, giving them insights into social robots and their designs [43]. We then encouraged the participants to consider various robots from the videos and the predistributed ones to address their emotional challenges...We ended up with a conclusion (15 minutes) and summarised the key insights from the workshop. We used this approach to lower participation barriers by giving them control over the design content and a shared understanding of their thoughts to criticise and improve the design as a group."

## acceptance
Answer: Participants preferred animal-like, companion pet robots and expressed acceptance of such designs for addressing emotional challenges
Source: "older adults preferred an animal-like robot design embodied with soft skin possessing a medium size...Participants realised this by adapting the robots' capabilities to their needs, including the potential to help them connect with others, reduce loneliness and anxiety, and address emotional challenges. Consequently, they desired a companion pet robot..."

## trust
Answer: Trust is implied through preference for accessible, user-friendly, and privacy-respecting designs; concerns about privacy and usability may reduce trust
Source: "To ensure that social robots are accessible and user-friendly for older adults with physical and sensory impairments, it is essential to balance practical features with privacy concerns...a potential privacy issue was raised with incorporating a display screen, camera, and microphone as P17 stated that, 'A display screen may threaten me if I don't know how to use it.'"

## key_findings
Answer: The impact of COVID-19 on older adults' emotional well-being persists; older adults prefer animal-like, soft, medium-sized companion robots with interactive features; co-design workshops effectively elicit user preferences; social robots can support mental well-being by providing companionship and emotional support.
Source: "Our results based on thematic analysis show that the impact of the pandemic on older adults' emotional challenges is persisting, and the companionship of a social robot is preferred to enhance their mental well-being. We also show that older adults preferred an animal-like robot design embodied with soft skin possessing a medium size. These findings highlighted older adults' design choices of a social robot and affirmed their potential to support older adults' mental well-being."

## additional_info
Answer: Study limitations include a local sample from one city, potential lack of generalizability, and the need for future research with more diverse participants and ethical considerations.
Source: "Our workshop examined the mental well-being of older adults in a local city following COVID-19, yet our qualitative transcriptions provided confidence in the results...we aim to address mental well-being issues in general by covering a more comprehensive sample of our participants from different cultures and considering ethical concerns while building social robots in the future."

## testing_context
Answer: Co-design workshop setting, likely in a community or university facility (not explicitly stated as lab or care home)
Source: "We followed the dialogue-labs method to run the codesign workshop, to facilitate participation for collaborative ideation and concept development by providing structured space, materials, and activities [48] (See Fig. 1)."
