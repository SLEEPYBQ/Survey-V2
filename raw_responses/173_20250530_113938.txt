Source: "The remaining 11 participants were aged between 67 and 94 (M = 75.09, SD = 7.18)..."

## gender
Answer: 6 females and 5 males
Source: "The remaining 11 participants... consisted of six females and five males (Table 1)."

## demographic_background
Answer: Participants were mostly White, with one Black and one Asian participant; educational levels ranged from secondary/vocational to master's degrees; fields included neurology, nursing, publishing, social work, manufacturing, design, education, business, and urban planning; most were retired, some employed part-time or full-time; all lived independently in owned houses or condos, not in senior communities; most owned phones, tablets, and computers; some had smart TVs and smart speakers; participants reported being moderately experienced with technology and slightly familiar with robots.
Source: "Participants were aged between 67 and 94... consisted of six females and five males (Table 1)... Five of the 11 participants reported that they have a chronic disease... Participants reported being moderately experienced with technology (M = 2.82, SD = 1.17)... Most participants owned phones, tablets, and computers. In addition, some participants reported having smart TVs and smart speakers... All participants in our study lived in houses or condos that they owned, and their residences were not part of senior communities."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Participants reported mild physical impairment (M = 2.00, SD = 0.77) on a 1–5 scale (1: Good physical health, 5: Complete physical impairment); able to perform everyday activities at a good capacity (M = 2.09, SD = 0.94); none reported cognitive health conditions; some had chronic diseases; specific sensory impairments included macular degeneration and hearing loss in one participant.
Source: "Participants reported having mild physical impairment (M = 2.00, SD = 0.77) (1: Good physical health, 5: Complete physical impairment) and being able to perform everyday activities at a good capacity (M = 2.09, SD = 0.94) (1: Excellent, 5: Completely impaired). None of the participants reported having cognitive health conditions... One of our study participants, P3, had constraints in their sensory capabilities, as macular degeneration made it difficult for them to perceive small or low-contrast details and interpret depth correctly, and a tumor in their ear affected their hearing."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs and expectations included a preference for familiar and direct programming methods (especially speech-based), minimal use of peripheral devices, programming methods that accommodate changing physical and cognitive abilities, support for collaborative/multi-user programming, and programming as a cognitive exercise; concerns included reliability, effort, and having sufficient mental models of robot behavior.
Source: "Participants preferred programming methods involving familiar and direct interactions that require minimal use of peripheral devices (e.g., talking, drawing, gesturing)... The most popular programming approach was verbal, however, with all participants indicating that the most familiar programming method they could envision is speech-based programming... Participants' preferred interaction modalities are determined based on their changing abilities as they age... Participants may need help from others to program robot assistance as they age... Some participants viewed programming the Kinova arm as a fun, interesting, and stimulating cognitive exercise... Participants' primary concerns at the prospect of adopting robot assistance involved having insufficient or incorrect mental models of how the robot will behave."

## application_context
Answer: In-home physical robot assistance for older adults, specifically for household tasks such as handling food, loading a dish rack, retrieving a grocery bag, dusting, and similar activities.
Source: "We observed older individuals' and couples' experiences in programming a contemporary robot arm to assist with household tasks, such as handling food, loading a dish rack, or retrieving a grocery bag."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Single-session, first-encounter, short-term use; each session lasted approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours, including interviews and programming tasks.
Source: "Each study session took approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours... Our study examined single interaction sessions between participants and robots..."

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative field study using semi-structured interviews and observations, with applied thematic analysis of transcripts and field notes.
Source: "We used a combination of semi-structured interviews and observations that we audio- or video-recorded and documented through field notes... All audio and video data and field notes were transcribed and then analyzed using applied thematic analysis..."

## care_type
Answer: Physical assistance with household and daily living tasks
Source: "We observed older individuals' and couples' experiences in programming a contemporary robot arm to assist with household tasks, such as handling food, loading a dish rack, or retrieving a grocery bag."

## robot_type
Answer: Contemporary robot arm (7-DOF Kinova Gen3 cobot arm with a 2-finger gripper)
Source: "We used a lightweight 7-DOF Kinova Gen3 cobot arm with a 2-finger gripper and web-based programming interface (Figure 3)."

## robot_name
Answer: Kinova Gen3
Source: "We used a lightweight 7-DOF Kinova Gen3 cobot arm with a 2-finger gripper and web-based programming interface (Figure 3)."

## design_goal
Answer: To explore the feasibility and potential of engaging older adults in programming physical robot assistance and to inform the design of future robot programming interactions for older adults.
Source: "Our work aims to understand older adults' perspectives as prospective users within the contexts of their homes, while also eliciting design feedback on how contemporary robot programming methods may need to evolve to maximize usability and accessibility for older adults."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: The robot was demonstrated performing household tasks such as dusting, retrieving items from shelves, loading dishes onto a drying rack, holding pantry items, and moving cups/plates; programming was done via kinesthetic teaching and a web-based interface.
Source: "Examples of tasks participants chose to program included dusting surfaces (Figure 2), retrieving items from high shelves, and loading dishes onto a drying rack... To program task motions, participants used the Kinova Kortex web app, a programming interface developed by Kinova that allows users to maneuver the robot to different positions by hand using kinesthetic teaching and engage in waypoint-based programming..."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Kinesthetic teaching was perceived as intuitive and familiar by some participants; the ability to physically guide the robot was likened to an extension of their own arm; collaborative programming allowed splitting workload and mutual support; programming was seen as cognitively stimulating and enjoyable by some.
Source: "P3 particularly liked the kinesthetic teaching aspect of the contemporary programming method, stating 'I like the intuitive nature of just manipulating the arm because it kinda simulates the movement that I want to accomplish. It's almost like it's kind of an extension of your arm.'... Programming with a partner had advantages, such as helping with splitting the programming workload, providing encouragement and motivation, and identifying program errors... Some participants viewed programming the Kinova arm as a fun, interesting, and stimulating cognitive exercise."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Kinesthetic teaching required significant physical effort and was inaccessible for those with mobility or sensory impairments; the web-based interface was difficult for those with limited computer experience or vision problems; remembering multi-step programming sequences was challenging; use of peripheral devices was disliked; lack of familiarity increased anxiety and perceived difficulty.
Source: "The programming method for the Kinova arm lacks accessibility for older adults with changing physical, sensory, and cognitive abilities... Participants experienced programming difficulties due to aging-related changes... Participants indicated that kinesthetic teaching using the Kinova involved too much friction... Some participants (P3, P5) were unable to use the screen-based interface due to visual constraints or inexperience with using computers... Most of our participants had difficulty remembering all the steps... Participants who perceived programming the Kinova as unfamiliar were more likely to view the programming method as scary or difficult."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Familiarity with similar automation or technology, positive attitude toward cognitive challenges, prior experience with computers or robots, ability to relate programming to familiar tasks, and collaborative skills (e.g., working with a partner) facilitated better use and acceptance.
Source: "Participants who perceived programming the Kinova arm as familiar had more positive programming experiences... Participants who were able to tie the programming method back to interactions they were familiar with tended to have an easier and more positive experience programming the Kinova... We observed various effective collaboration strategies among the couples in our study who programmed the robot together..."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Limited mobility, sensory impairments (e.g., vision, hearing), lack of computer or technology experience, low familiarity with robots, memory difficulties, and anxiety about unfamiliar technology or fear of breaking the robot reduced use and acceptance.
Source: "Participants' changing abilities in mobility, perception, and cognition as they age framed their expectations, experiences, and preferences... Some participants who lacked fine motor control preferred not to program robot assistance using computer interfaces... P3 had difficulty seeing the keyboard and web-based interface... Participants who perceived programming the Kinova as unfamiliar were more likely to view the programming method as scary or difficult."

## engagement
Answer: Engagement varied; some participants found programming fun, interesting, and stimulating, showing signs of enjoyment (smiling, applause), while others felt anxious, nervous, or fatigued, especially when unfamiliar with the method or facing physical/cognitive barriers.
Source: "Some participants viewed programming the Kinova arm as a fun, interesting, and stimulating cognitive exercise... Several participants perceived the programming process and interface positively. They indicated that the process was fun, enjoyable, interesting, cool, and easy to learn, with some participants expressing nonverbal signs of enjoyment while programming such as smiling or applause... On the other hand, participants who perceived programming the Kinova as unfamiliar were more likely to view the programming method as scary or difficult. For example, P9 indicated that the process made them anxious and nervous, and P5 said that they were initially scared..."

## acceptance
Answer: Acceptance was mixed; some participants could envision using the robot/programming in the future as needs increased, but many found the current method too complex or inaccessible for themselves or for older adults with greater impairments; most preferred programming by others or with support.
Source: "Participants did see potential benefits over the long term... However, although participants perceived themselves as needing robot assistance more as their capabilities become more constrained in the future, they also perceived programming a robot as less feasible at that point... P7 stated that the interface was too complicated for them and that they would only use the arm if someone else programmed it for them."

## trust
Answer: Some participants expressed concerns about trusting the robot to behave as expected, especially due to insufficient or incorrect mental models; programming helped some refine their trust and understanding of the robot's capabilities and limitations.
Source: "Participants' primary concerns at the prospect of adopting robot assistance involved having insufficient or incorrect mental models of how the robot will behave... P3 asked, 'Especially until I were to get used to it, wondering, can I really trust this? This machine. Is this assistant going to do what they say it's going to do?'... Programming the Kinova arm helped some participants refine and strengthen their mental models about the robot's capabilities and limitations."

## key_findings
Answer: Five key factors shape older adults' expectations, experiences, and preferences in programming physical robot assistance: (1) familiarity with automation and interactions, (2) changes in abilities due to aging, (3) multi-user and collaborative programming, (4) cognitive exercise, and (5) mental model formation; recommendations include leveraging familiarity, supporting aging-related changes, enabling collaboration, structuring programming as cognitive exercise, and supporting mental model formation.
Source: "Our analysis revealed five themes corresponding to factors shaping participants' expectations, experiences, and preferences regarding robot programming (Table 3)... Based on these findings, we recommend guidelines to consider when designing future robot programming interactions for older adults."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small and relatively homogeneous sample (mostly healthy, independent, technologically experienced, and interested in robots), single-session/short-term exposure, use of a specific robot/interface, and potential overconstraint of participant imagination; future work should include more diverse samples, longer-term and naturalistic studies, and broader robot types.
Source: "Our study was limited to participants who require no major assistance with activities of daily living, which influences our findings... Participants in our study were relatively experienced with technology and had some degree of familiarity with robots... Our study examined single interaction sessions between participants and robots... By showing participants a robot programming system that only allows programming of motions and not tasks that would require sensing or generalization, we may have overconstrained our participants' ideas and feedback about robot assistance and limited their imagination..."

## testing_context
Answer: Participants' private residences (homes or condos they owned, not part of senior communities)
Source: "We conducted study sessions in participants' residences. All participants in our study lived in houses or condos that they owned, and their residences were not part of senior communities."
