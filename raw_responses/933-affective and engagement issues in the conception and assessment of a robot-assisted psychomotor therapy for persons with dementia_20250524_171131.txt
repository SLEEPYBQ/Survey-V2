## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Persons with dementia (PwD), caregivers, therapists, and robotics experts
Source: Nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions

## sample_size
Answer: 9 persons with dementia
Source: Nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated

## country
Answer: France
Source: The study was conducted in the Broca Geriatric Hospital (Paris)

## age
Answer: Mean age = 86 years, range not specified
Source: Nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o)

## gender
Answer: 7 women and 2 men
Source: Nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o)

## demographic_background
Answer: Hospitalized in a geriatrics unit; education level ranged from 3 (validation of primary school) to 7 (higher education degree)
Source: EL, Education level, ranging from 1 (validation of primary school) to 7 (higher education degree)

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Participants had a clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia; MMSE scores ranged from 12 to 22
Source: Inclusion criteria were: having a clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia and having signed a consent form. MMSE scores ranged from 12 to 22.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs included engagement in therapy, emotional support, and personalized interactions. Expectations were met through robot-assisted therapy.
Source: The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.

## application_context
Answer: Robot-assisted psychomotor therapy for persons with dementia in a hospital setting
Source: The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session and three robot-assisted therapy (RAT) sessions
Source: The intervention program consisted in 4 individual sessions of psychomotor therapy including: one classical psychomotor therapy session (CT) and 3 RAT sessions.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys, and video-based behavioral analysis
Source: The encoding and analysis of the video recordings was carried out by two researchers using the adapted form of the MPES.

## care_type
Answer: Psychomotor therapy
Source: A psychomotor therapist conceived a short therapeutic program for PwD structured in four individual sessions.

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid robot
Source: The NAO robot, Version V4 (Softbank robotics)

## robot_name
Answer: NAO
Source: The NAO robot, Version V4 (Softbank robotics)

## design_goal
Answer: To create a highly acceptable and empathic interaction style for the robot, tailor program contents to participants' preferences, and establish a collaborative framework involving therapist, patient, and robot
Source: Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents).

## robot_concern_function
Answer: The robot assisted in therapy sessions by modeling movements, asking questions, and providing feedback
Source: The robot was used to introduce and model the physical exercises, ask cognitive questions, and perform body expression activities.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Personalized interactions, empathic behaviors, and positive feedback enhanced engagement and emotional responses
Source: The robot was designed to adapt to the cognitive level of PwD, by adjusting the difficulty of exercises and being supportive.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Technical limitations and the need for external operation (Wizard of Oz technique) could hinder natural interaction
Source: The robot was not able to perform any automatic behavior, requiring sustained attention from the operator.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher cognitive function (MMSE) and presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., apathy) were associated with better engagement
Source: The levels of Constructive Engagement in RAT sessions and the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms were positively correlated.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe dementia (MMSE < 10) and sensory deficits were exclusion criteria, indicating these could reduce acceptance
Source: Exclusion criteria were: severe dementia (MMSE < 10/30), sensory deficit (vision and hearing) and severe acute illness impeding the participation in RAT sessions.

## engagement
Answer: High constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions; more positive emotional responses in RAT
Source: Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT.

## acceptance
Answer: RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions; robot acceptance score was 4.7/5
Source: RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The robot was very well accepted by all participants as shown by a satisfaction score of 4.7/5.

## trust
Answer: Participants exhibited empathy-related behaviors toward the robot, indicating trust
Source: Eight participants showed direct empathy with the robot, that is, they attributed the robot emotional states and its own perspectives.

## key_findings
Answer: High engagement and positive emotional responses in RAT; robot acceptance was high; empathy-related behaviors were observed
Source: The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, lack of a control group, and technical constraints of the robot
Source: The present study presents some methodological limitations that should be taken into consideration when interpreting the above presented findings.

## testing_context
Answer: Hospital rooms in a geriatrics unit
Source: Therapy sessions were held in the patient's hospital room.
