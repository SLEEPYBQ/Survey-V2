## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Older adults, caregivers, and robotics experts
Source: "We interviewed 191 older adults; investigated their preferences on the design elements of robots including type, weight, and material; and analyzed the data by age, gender, and living arrangement."

## sample_size
Answer: 191 older adults
Source: "Therefore, we included 191 older adults for statistical analysis (Female = 135, age M = 77.33)."

## country
Answer: Korea
Source: "Young Hoon Oh, Jaewoong Kim, Soyon Jeong and Da Young Ju are with Yonsei University, Incheon, 21983 Korea."

## age
Answer: Mean age = 77.33, grouped into young-old (65-74), middle-old (75-84), and oldest-old (over 85)
Source: "age M = 77.33" and "we grouped the subjects by age: young-old (aged 65 to 74), middle-old (aged 75 to 84), and oldest-old (aged over 85)."

## gender
Answer: Female = 135, Male = 56
Source: "The number of respondents was slightly different from the previous study [18] because four subjects did not fill in their living arrangement. Therefore, we included 191 older adults for statistical analysis (Female = 135, age M = 77.33)."

## demographic_background
Answer: Living arrangement (living alone, living with spouse, living with family), depression level (HIGH and LOW based on SGDS-K scores)
Source: "Moreover, we divided the subjects by living arrangement: living alone (LA from below), living with spouse (LWS from below), and living with family (LWF from below)." and "As Bae et al. validated the optimal cutoff point of SGDS-K [30], we grouped the participants who scored 8 or more as HIGH. The other participants were grouped as LOW."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Older adults living alone prefer bear-like robots and lighter weights; they are sensitive to material softness and cleanliness.
Source: "Our findings indicated that those living alone prefer a bear-like robot and negative to the heavy robot." and "LA may have felt burdened with managing or washing robots."

## application_context
Answer: Companion robots for psychological assistance and social interaction for older adults, especially those living alone.
Source: "To address this issue, various companion robots, which are capable of psychologically communicating with users, have been proposed."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Quantitative survey with Likert-scale questions, statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-tests)
Source: "We interviewed 191 older adults; investigated their preferences on the design elements of robots including type, weight, and material; and analyzed the data by age, gender, and living arrangement."

## care_type
Answer: Psychological and social support
Source: "To address this issue, various companion robots, which are capable of psychologically communicating with users, have been proposed."

## robot_type
Answer: Bear-like, dog-like, seal-like, humanoid, and newborn baby-like robots
Source: "The subjects were given four stuffed toys and a humanoid robot, as shown in Fig. 1."

## robot_name
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## design_goal
Answer: To design companion robots with consideration of older adults' physical and psychological preferences, especially for those living alone.
Source: "Our primary goal was to determine how companion robots should be designed, paying special attention to older adults who live alone."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Preference evaluation for type, weight, and material of companion robots
Source: "We interviewed 191 older adults; investigated their preferences on the design elements of robots including type, weight, and material."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Bear-like design (soft and warm feelings), lighter weight, microfiber material (soft and preferred)
Source: "They were negative to the heavy robot." and "microfibers were the most preferred material."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Heavy weight, synthetic fibers (less soft and harder to clean)
Source: "As the weight of the companion robot increased, their robot preference decreased." and "HIGH was significantly negative for synthetic fibers."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Older adults living alone with depression prefer bear-like robots and lighter weights.
Source: "Compared to other groups, LA had the most highly depressed people (n = 31). This means that LA is more depressed than those living with others, and the bear is the most suitable companion for them."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Older adults living alone are more sensitive to heavy weight and synthetic materials.
Source: "LA may have felt burdened with managing or washing robots."

## engagement
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## acceptance
Answer: Older adults preferred lighter weights and microfiber materials; bear-like robots were favored by those living alone.
Source: "As the weight of the companion robot increased, their robot preference decreased." and "microfibers were the most preferred material."

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Older adults living alone prefer bear-like robots and lighter weights; microfiber is the most preferred material. Design should consider physical and psychological preferences.
Source: "Our findings indicated that those living alone prefer a bear-like robot and negative to the heavy robot." and "The results of the research showed that various characteristics of the elderly need to be considered to provide a design suitable for them."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include potential bias due to participants' limited understanding of companion robots.
Source: "However, these results are limited to the five types of robots. Preference for the robots might vary depending on the robot's features [25]."

## testing_context
Answer: Senior care centers in Korea
Source: "In this study, we recruited older adults at four different senior care centers to minimize the cultural bias."
