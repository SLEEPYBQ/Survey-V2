Source: Age: 18–24 years (42, 19.2%), 25–34 years (66, 30.1%), 35–44 years (43, 19.6%), 45–54 years (41, 18.7%), More than 54 years (27, 12.4%).

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Men considered perceived usefulness and ease of use as main motives, while women valued social influence and perceived enjoyment more.
Source: While women gave greater social influence and perceived enjoyment as the main motives for using a social robot, in contrast, men considered their perceived usefulness to be the principal reason and, as a differential argument, the ease of use.

## application_context
Answer: Entertainment and companionship
Source: Entertainment and companion robots, designed for leisure purposes, would be close to the relationship classified by Weber as owner-pet. These robots can interact with people by singing, dancing, playing games, facilitating communication with relatives and, in general, preventing loneliness.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use during a game interaction
Source: To carry out the field work, we installed a stand consisting of two adjacent spaces and, to encourage participation, we invited visitors to take part in a game with a TIAGo robot.

## methodology
Answer: Quantitative surveys (SEM analysis of UTAUT model)
Source: Both the general model and the models resulting from dividing the sample between sexes or between cognitive systems were estimated by SEM, from variance and covariance matrices according to maximum likelihood with EQS 6.4.

## care_type
Answer: Entertainment and companionship
Source: Entertainment and companion robots, designed for leisure purposes, would be close to the relationship classified by Weber as owner-pet.

## robot_type
Answer: Semi-humanoid robot (TIAGo)
Source: TIAGo is a semi-humanoid robot whose physiognomy is made up of a head, a torso, an integrated arm and a base for its displacement.

## robot_name
Answer: TIAGo
Source: TIAGo is a semi-humanoid robot whose physiognomy is made up of a head, a torso, an integrated arm and a base for its displacement.

## design_goal
Answer: To evaluate acceptance of entertainment robots and segment users by gender and cognitive system.
Source: This study has a double objective: first, to propose and test a parsimonious technological acceptance model for the case of social robots after a real entertainment experience, based on the UTAUT. Second, we put forward the idea of segmentation, in the sense that not all users (male and female, more rational or heuristic) will express the same degree of acceptance of new robot prototypes.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Entertainment (playing a word game), providing assistance and companionship.
Source: The goal of inviting participants to play a game with a TIAGo robot was to offer them a first-hand experience, as recommended by Suchman and Savela et al.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Social influence, perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and ease of use enhanced acceptance.
Source: The intention to use an entertainment robot is mainly explained by the social influence (0.45) and by the perceived enjoyment (0.31), a little less by the perceived usefulness (0.25), and ease of use (0.12) was the one that reached the lowest significant value.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Men valued perceived usefulness and ease of use; women valued social influence and perceived enjoyment. Rational users valued ease of use more than heuristic users.
Source: For women, perceived enjoyment will be a more important precedent of the intention to use the robot than for men. For participants using heuristics (system 1), perceived social influence will be a more important precedent for the intention to use the robot than for participants using reasoning (system 2).

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## engagement
Answer: High engagement inferred from high intention to use (R² = 0.90).
Source: The R² generated were in line with the sample size used: an R² of 0.90 for the intention to use as the dependent variable.

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance, with social influence and perceived enjoyment as key drivers.
Source: The intention to use an entertainment robot is mainly explained by the social influence (0.45) and by the perceived enjoyment (0.31).

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Gender differences are significant: men focus on usefulness and ease of use, while women prioritize social influence and enjoyment. Rational users value ease of use more than heuristic users.
Source: The results show that gender differences are more important than suggested by the literature. While women gave greater social influence and perceived enjoyment as the main motives for using a social robot, in contrast, men considered their perceived usefulness to be the principal reason and, as a differential argument, the ease of use.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include first-time interaction bias and convenience sampling. Future research could explore long-term interactions.
Source: Findings gathered in this research should be taken with caution, since all participants experienced for the first time an interaction with a semi-humanoid social robot, so the technological acceptance model and the intention to use are very hypothetical.

## testing_context
Answer: Ecological fair in Barcelona (real-world setting)
Source: The sample was collected among thousands of visitors who, during a weekend, attended a fair on ecological, intelligent and sustainable products in the city of Barcelona.
