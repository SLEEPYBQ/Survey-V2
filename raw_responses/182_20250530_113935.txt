## design_goal
Answer: To provide support, companionship, and practical benefits in psychosocial care for older adults; to assist health professionals in achieving care objectives and making care work more interesting.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Greater awareness of social robots is associated with more positive attitudes; working in nursing homes (vs. residential aged care) is associated with higher positive attitude scores.

## key_findings
Answer: The ATTUSR-C questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing health professionals' attitudes towards social robots in LTC; health personnel in Taiwan generally have positive attitudes towards social robots for older adults in LTC, viewing them as beneficial and practical in psychosocial care; awareness of social robots and working in nursing homes are associated with more positive attitudes.
Source: "The evidence indicates that the ATTUSR-C questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the acceptability of social robots for health professionals working in LTC facilities. ... health personnel had positive attitudes towards the use of social robots for older adults in LTC as they viewed social robots as beneficial and practical in psychosocial care for older adults. ... the attitudes of health personnel towards the use of social robots for older adults in LTC were significantly influenced by their awareness of social robots. ... respondents working in nursing homes ... had significantly higher positive attitude scores towards social robots than those in residential aged care..."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include: attitudes measured do not reflect intent to use; majority of respondents were female, possibly introducing gender bias; limited exposure to social robots among participants; ATTUSR-C is a new tool and lacks convergent validity assessment.
Source: "This study had some limitations. First, the measure of attitudes used in the current research does not reflect the intent to use social robots. ... the majority of online survey respondents were female (85.8%) and this may give rise to gender response bias that limits the generalization of the results. ... health personnel ... had limited exposure to and experience in the use of social robots, and this may be a further limitation of this research. ... the ATTUSR-C questionnaire is a new tool for use by health personnel. As there is no related Chinese questionnaire to assess convergent validity, further work to examine the convergent validity of this questionnaire is warranted."

## testing_context
Answer: Online survey conducted with health personnel working in long-term care facilities in Taiwan; no physical robot deployment or in-person testing.
