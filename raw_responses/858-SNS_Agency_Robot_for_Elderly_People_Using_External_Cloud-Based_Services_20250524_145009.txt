Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided research paper:

## Involved Stakeholder
Elderly people, caregivers, and technical solution providers (researchers).

Source: "The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman." and "we asked her daughter lived in different prefecture, a care worker of Mon-san Nagasaki, and our research staff to register the LINE account for PaPeRo."

## Sample Size
3 elderly participants (78, 87, and 88 years old), but only data from the 78-year-old woman (Ms. A) was analyzed due to health issues of the other two.

Source: "The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman." and "we decided to evaluate the communication history of Ms. A."

## Country
Japan (Nagasaki prefecture).

Source: "at the house for the elderly with the care service at Togitsu-machi in Nagasaki prefecture in Japan."

## Age
78, 87, and 88 years old.

Source: "The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman."

## Gender
2 women (78 and 88 years old) and 1 man (87 years old).

Source: "The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman."

## Demographic Background
Elderly people who cannot use smartphones, living in a care service facility.

Source: "They could not use smartphones." and "at the house for the elderly with the care service."

## Cognitive And Physical Impairment
N/A (not explicitly mentioned).

## Needs And Expectations
Elderly people want tighter connections with society and simpler interfaces for communication.

Source: "current services are not enough for elderly people who want to have more tight connection with society" and "realizing the simple user interface."

## Application Context
Home or care facility for elderly people to communicate with younger generations via SNS.

Source: "After setting this robot at an elderly person's house" and "at the house for the elderly with the care service."

## Process Of The Care
Short-term use (6 weeks), with daily interactions.

Source: "from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016."

## Methodology
Demonstration experiment with qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Source: "we confirmed the effectiveness of the message destination estimation through the demonstration experiment."

## Care Type
Social communication and remote monitoring.

Source: "interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via existing Social Networking Service (SNS)."

## Robot Type
Human-type robot (PaPeRo).

Source: "PaPeRo, which stands for 'Partner-type-Personal-Robot', is a personal robot developed by Japanese firm NEC Corporation."

## Robot Name
PaPeRo.

Source: "PaPeRo, which stands for 'Partner-type-Personal-Robot'."

## Design Goal
Simple voice-operated interface for elderly people to use SNS without smartphones.

Source: "elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via SNS without using smartphones."

## Robot Concern Function
Voice-based message sending/receiving via LINE, message destination estimation.

Source: "elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via LINE" and "message exchange learning-type destination estimation method."

## Facilitating Functions
Voice operation (simplifies interaction), automatic message destination estimation (reduces user effort).

Source: "realizing the simple user interface" and "enables elderly people not to express a message destination address explicitly."

## Inhibitory Functions
Temporary drop in destination estimation accuracy during initial learning phase.

Source: "the fourth week accuracy is temporarily down."

## Stakeholder Facilitating Characteristics
Elderly people enjoyed using the robot initially.

Source: "all test subjects enjoyed using PaPeRo."

## Stakeholder Inhibitory Characteristics
Health issues prevented continued use by two participants.

Source: "the physical condition of 87 years old man and 88 years old woman turned worse during experiment period."

## Engagement
High initial engagement but dropped due to health issues.

Source: "all test subjects enjoyed using PaPeRo" and "the physical condition of 87 years old man and 88 years old woman turned worse."

## Acceptance
N/A (not explicitly measured).

## Trust
N/A (not explicitly measured).

## Key Findings
The message destination estimation achieved >80% accuracy, proving the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Source: "we confirmed that we were able to achieve the message destination estimation probability of more than 80% at the last period of the demonstration experiment."

## Additional Info
Limitations include small sample size and health issues affecting participation.

Source: "the physical condition of 87 years old man and 88 years old woman turned worse during experiment period."

## Testing Context
Care facility for elderly people.

Source: "at the house for the elderly with the care service, named Mon-san Nagasaki in Togitsu-machi, Nagasaki prefecture."
