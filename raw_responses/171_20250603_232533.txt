## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Negative attitude toward robots, preference for practical tasks over social interaction, concerns about robots being harmful for people with dementia
Source: "Some other participants expressed that the robot could be useful in a care home to control lights or the TV but not for conversation. It was even raised by several people that Furhat could potentially be harmful for people with dementia."

## application_context
Answer: Care homes for older adults
Source: "With more robots entering social environments, such as care homes for older adults, it is increasingly important to understand the target user groups' perception of different robot platforms that are introduced into their immediate surroundings."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term interaction (10-minute conversation)
Source: "After roughly 10 minutes of conversation, the robot said goodbye and the participant was asked to return to the other room and fill in the GODSPEED and NARS questionnaire."

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys (GODSPEED and NARS questionnaires)
Source: "We measured the participants' perceptions of Furhat using the GODSPEED and NARS questionnaires."

## care_type
Answer: Social care
Source: "Social robots are envisioned both to educate and entertain children, as well as provide company and increase quality of life for older adults."

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid robot head with a virtual (backprojected) face
Source: "Furhat, a blended embodiment of a physical robot head with a virtual (backprojected) face, is being marketed as one of the most social robots with high human-likeness."

## robot_name
Answer: Furhat
Source: "Furhat, a blended embodiment of a physical robot head with a virtual (backprojected) face, is being marketed as one of the most social robots with high human-likeness."

## design_goal
Answer: To create a highly social robot with high human-likeness
Source: "Furhat, a blended embodiment of a physical robot head with a virtual (backprojected) face, is being marketed as one of the most social robots with high human-likeness."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Conversation, facial expressions, voice interaction
Source: "The robot can turn its head with a human-like neck design, which creates a natural head movement, both up and down, and to the sides. On the front of the robot, there is a 135°field-of-view camera, and it also has two microphones and one speaker."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Friendly and curious personality, polite words, initiating questions
Source: "The personality of the robot was friendly and curious, with the robot saying polite words (e.g., 'thank you' and 'please') as well as the robot initiating questions and stating that it wanted to learn more from the participants."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Lack of human-like body, perceived as machine-like
Source: "The results indicate that older adults do not perceive the robots as alive (mean = 2.19, SD = 0.73) or human-like (mean = 2.00, SD = 0.70)."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Engagement in interaction despite negative attitudes
Source: "However, despite the negative comments and survey results, all participants were engaged in the interaction. All talked to the robot, answered its questions, and many asked their own."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Negative attitude toward robots, preference for practical tasks, concerns about robots being harmful for people with dementia
Source: "Some other participants expressed that the robot could be useful in a care home to control lights or the TV but not for conversation. It was even raised by several people that Furhat could potentially be harmful for people with dementia."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement in interaction despite negative attitudes
Source: "However, despite the negative comments and survey results, all participants were engaged in the interaction. All talked to the robot, answered its questions, and many asked their own."

## acceptance
Answer: Low social acceptance for Furhat
Source: "However, our results differ from previous studies by indicating that older adults have relatively low social acceptance for Furhat and a relatively negative attitude toward robots after meeting Furhat."

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Older adults do not perceive Furhat as anthropomorphic or sentient, have a negative attitude toward robots with emotions after meeting Furhat, but were engaged in the interaction.
Source: "However, this study's results indicates that older adults do not perceive Furhat as anthropomorphic or sentient, and they especially reported a negative attitude toward robots with emotions after meeting Furhat. Despite these scores, all participants were engaged in the interaction with the robot."

## additional_info
Answer: Recruitment was unexpectedly difficult; some older adults declined participation after seeing the robot or did not want to interact with it alone.
Source: "Some older adults expressed that they did not want anything to do with a robot, some declined participation after seeing the robot, and some did not want to interact with the robot alone."

## testing_context
Answer: Senior centre in Linköping, Sweden
Source: "The study was conducted at a senior centre in Linköping, which is the fifth largest municipality in Sweden in terms of population (about 165,000)."
