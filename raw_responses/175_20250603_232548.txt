## demographic_background  
Answer: 61.54% with ≤9 years of education and 38.46% with >9 years in the experimental group; 50.88% with ≤9 years and 49.12% with >9 years in the comparison group. Common comorbidities included high blood pressure (53.85% experimental, 54.39% comparison) and diabetes (19.23% experimental, 31.58% comparison).  
Source: "£9 years (junior high school): 32 (61.54%), >9 years: 20 (38.46%) in the experimental group; £9 years: 29 (50.88%), >9 years: 28 (49.12%) in the comparison group."  

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment  
Answer: Participants had mild cognitive impairment (MMSE scores 18–23). No severe chronic diseases like stroke were included.  
Source: "The selection criteria for participating were (1) residents with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores from 18 to 23, (2) individuals' willingness to comply with verbal instructions, and (3) to avoid influencing the robot's operation, no severe chronic diseases such as a stroke."  

## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Needs included improving cognitive function, reducing depression, and enhancing life satisfaction. Expectations were met through cooperative gameplay and social interaction.  
Source: "Players' feedback indicates that cooperative gameplay, rather than competition, improves depression and life satisfaction."  

## application_context  
Answer: Long-term care facilities and day-care centers  
Source: "The training occurred in the long-term care facility (LTC) where the residents live."  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: 12 once-weekly 60-minute sessions over 3 months  
Source: "The experimental group underwent 3 months of robot-assisted board game training, that is, 12 once-weekly 60-minute sessions."  

## methodology  
Answer: Cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up measurements  
Source: "A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted, following the CONSORT extension guidelines."  

## care_type  
Answer: Cognitive training and mental health support  
Source: "The effectiveness of robot-assisted board games targeting older adults with mild cognitive impairment was investigated to improve their cognitive function, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction and reduce depression."  

## robot_type  
Answer: Child-like robot  
Source: "The small, easy-to-operate, child-like robots made cognitive training engaging."  

## robot_name  
Answer: Kebbi  
Source: "Players scan the QR codes on the cards to trigger the robot to display questions or training tasks."  

## design_goal  
Answer: To improve cognitive function, general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and reduce depression among older adults with MCI  
Source: "The effectiveness of robot-assisted board games targeting older adults with mild cognitive impairment was investigated to improve their cognitive function, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction and reduce depression."  

## robot_concern_function  
Answer: Interactive board game tasks based on MMSE and ADAS-Cog domains, including orientation, memory, and language skills  
Source: "The six topics, descriptions, and corresponding aspects of MMSE and ADAS-Cog are contained in the Supplementary Table S1."  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Cooperative gameplay, social interaction, and personalized feedback from the robot enhanced engagement and cognitive benefits.  
Source: "Players are encouraged to cooperate to answer questions or complete cognitive training tasks."  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Higher cognitive capabilities and familiarity with robot operations improved engagement.  
Source: "The authors suggested that older people with higher cognitive capabilities engaged more actively than those with lower capabilities."  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Participants with inconvenient hand movements or inability to operate robots were excluded.  
Source: "Older people with inconvenient hand movements, inability to operate robots, and inability to understand instructions or execute actions based on instructions were also excluded from the study."  

## engagement  
Answer: High engagement was reported, with a mean SUS score of 87.50 indicating usability.  
Source: "The mean SUS score was 87.50 – 4.61, which indicates that the participants found the system usable."  

## acceptance  
Answer: High acceptance due to cooperative gameplay and social interaction.  
Source: "Players' feedback indicates that cooperative gameplay, rather than competition, improves depression and life satisfaction."  

## trust  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## key_findings  
Answer: Robot-assisted board games improved cognitive function, general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and reduced depression. Effects persisted at the 3-month follow-up.  
Source: "Our findings support the effectiveness of robot-assisted board games targeting older adults with MCI to improve their cognitive function, general self-efficacy, satisfaction with life, and depression."  

## additional_info  
Answer: Limitations included inability to distinguish individual vs. group interaction effects and challenges during COVID-19.  
Source: "The study encountered several limitations. First, it could not distinguish between intervention efficacy resulting from group or individual interactions."
