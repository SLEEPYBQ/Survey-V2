## gender
Answer: 17 females and 9 males

## demographic_background
Answer: 80% high independence in household chores, 30% bachelor's degree, 30% postgraduate degree, 40% high school or other education, all used technology regularly (smartphones and computers)
Source: "Eighty percent (21/26) indicated that they had high independence in performing household chores; the other 20% (5/26) reported moderate independence. Most of the participants had an academic degree: 30% (8/26) at bachelor's level and 30% (8/26) at the postgraduate level. The remainder (10/26) had high school or another level of education. All participants used technology regularly; they all had smartphones and computers."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for physical and cognitive training to maintain independence and quality of life; expectation of customizable and motivating feedback
Source: "Physical and cognitive training can maintain and improve older adults' independence and quality of life."

## application_context
Answer: Home environments or senior centers for physical and cognitive training
Source: "Experiments with 26 older adults (65–84 years of age) were performed in home environments"

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Two training sessions (one physical, one combined physical and cognitive), each session included six physical exercises and cognitive games if applicable
Source: "Each participant underwent two training sessions: one included only physical training, and the other included both physical and cognitive training."

## methodology
Answer: Within-subjects experimental design with qualitative and quantitative measures (questionnaires, success rate tracking)
Source: "We employed a 'within subjects' experimental design in which the dependent variables were subjective measures related to the acceptance of the training, as assessed by means of questionnaires."

## care_type
Answer: Physical and cognitive training
Source: "This study suggests that social robots can satisfy this demand and presents the development of 'Gymmy', a robotic system for the physical and cognitive training of older adults."

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid mechanical-looking robot (Poppy Torso)
Source: "The system design includes a humanoid mechanical-looking robot to demonstrate exercises"

## robot_name
Answer: Gymmy
Source: "the development of 'Gymmy', a robotic system for the physical and cognitive training of older adults."

## design_goal
Answer: To develop a robust, easy-to-use system for long-term independent operation by older adults in their homes, combining physical and cognitive training
Source: "The system was designed to be compact, robust, easy to use and enable long-term independent operation by older adults in their homes."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Demonstrates exercises, provides instructions and feedback via touch screen and speakers, monitors performance via RGB-D camera
Source: "The system design includes a humanoid mechanical-looking robot to demonstrate exercises, an RGB-Depth (RGB-D) camera to measure performance and a touch screen and speakers to provide instructions and feedback."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Clear feedback, customizable exercises, combination of physical and cognitive training
Source: "The findings highlight the importance of customizing the system to the needs of different users and the role of meaningful feedback."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Insertion of cognitive training in the middle of physical training was confusing for some users
Source: "Another issue that was raised by the participants was that the insertion of cognitive training in the middle of the physical training was problematic and confusing."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher education, positive attitude toward robots, higher success rate in exercises
Source: "The model's results showed that the user's attitude toward interactions with robots (NARS-S1) had a significant association with their rating of perceived usefulness; a higher level of NARS-S1 (implying greater negativity) resulted in lower ratings of perceived usefulness in comparison with the lower level."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Negative attitude toward robots, lower education level
Source: "The medium levels of NARS-S1 and NARS-S2 resulted in lower ratings for the ease of use than the low levels (NARS-S1 p = 0.005, NARS-S2 p = 0.024)."

## engagement
Answer: 80.77% high engagement ratings (mean Likert score = 4.212, SD = 0.874)
Source: "Most participants (80.77%) gave high ratings of engagement with the robotic physical trainer (mean Likert score = 4.212, SD = 0.874)."

## acceptance
Answer: 46.15% high acceptance ratings (mean Likert score = 3.5, SD = 1.257)
Source: "About half of the participants (46.15%) indicated a clear (i.e., rating of 4 or 5) intention to use the robotic system in the future, and 26.92% were neutral (mean Likert score = 3.5, SD = 1.257)."

## trust
Answer: 65.38% expressed trust in the trainer (mean Likert score = 3.865, SD = 0.975)
Source: "Similarly, the majority (65.38%) expressed trust in the trainer (mean Likert score = 3.865, SD = 0.975)."

## key_findings
Answer: Age, attitude, and education influenced acceptance; system was robust and reliable; customization and feedback are crucial
Source: "The results showed that age, attitude and education influenced the acceptance of the robotic system. The findings highlight the importance of customizing the system to the needs of different users and the role of meaningful feedback. The system was proven to be robust and reliable, demonstrating clear potential to be used as a personal trainer and as a means of motivating older adults."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include only upper-body exercises and small sample size; future work should test sitting exercises and include oldest-old group
Source: "The limitations of this work include the fact that only upper-body exercises were included in the system. This study is also limited by the absence of participants in the oldest-old group and by the sample size as discussed earlier."

## testing_context
Answer: Home environments or senior centers
Source: "Due to COVID-19, older adults were understandably reluctant to come to the university to participate in the experiments. Therefore, the sessions took place in their own homes or at senior centers located in their vicinity."
