================================================================================

## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, caregivers, and robotics researchers
Source: The authors carried out three experimental sessions with elderly people and discussed with them about their opinions on social and assistive robotics.

## sample_size
Answer: 12 participants in the first experiment, 8 in the second (4 elderly), and 22 in the third (16 elderly)
Source: Number of participants: 12 (first experiment), 8 (second experiment, 4 elderly), 22 (third experiment, 16 elderly).

## country
Answer: France
Source: LUSAGE Living Lab at the Broca hospital, Paris, welcomed the experiments.

## age
Answer: Participants were between 70 and 85 years old
Source: The experiments participants were between 70 and 85.

## gender
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## demographic_background
Answer: Elderly people were mostly unaware of digital technologies and socially isolated
Source: Most of elderly people are badly aware of digital technologies, becoming more and more socially isolated.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly participants preferred scenarios where the robot clearly asked them to say something (e.g., emotion game and quiz)
Source: The elderly preferred the emotion game and the quizz to a great extent. Those correspond to scenarios in which the robot clearly asks the user to say something.

## application_context
Answer: Personal robot companion for the elderly to assist in daily life interactions
Source: The ROMEO robot will be capable of moving, take items and give simple information to the user... to assist old people.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Each participant interacted with the robot between one and four times
Source: Each participant of the first and second session interacted with the robot only once while those of the third between one and four times.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys, and experimental sessions with autonomous and Wizard of Oz systems
Source: The authors carried out three experimental sessions... After each experiment, the researchers discussed (individually and in group) with them... participants had to fill a questionnaire.

## care_type
Answer: Social and assistive care
Source: The goal is to build an empathic robot... and it focuses on elderly people, the end-users expected by ROMEO2 project.

## robot_type
Answer: Human-like robots (NAO and Pepper)
Source: Pictures taken during interactions between: an elderly and Nao (on the left), an elderly and Pepper (on the right).

## robot_name
Answer: NAO and Pepper
Source: The robot was NAO... the robot was Pepper.

## design_goal
Answer: To build an empathic and humorous robot for elderly companionship
Source: The purpose of JOKER (JOKe and Emphathy of a Robot) project is to give a robot such a capability, as well as humor.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Emotion recognition, humor, negotiation, and cultural quiz scenarios
Source: Each interaction involved various scenarios dealing with emotion recognition, humor, negotiation and cultural quiz.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Emotion detection and adaptive behavior (e.g., humor or calming strategies based on user reactions)
Source: According to the user global reaction valence detected by the system, the robot chose a negotiation strategy: Humor, Reason, or Calming.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Incoherent answers due to speech recognition failures
Source: Sometimes, it failed at recognizing the speech from the user and then gave incoherent answers.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Positive affective states and engagement in scenarios where the robot clearly asked for input
Source: Participants feelings were globally positive... The elderly preferred the emotion game and the quizz to a great extent.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Doubt and unwillingness to engage due to robot errors
Source: Consequently, the user doubted about the quality of the conversation and turned unwilling to dialog with the robot.

## engagement
Answer: Speaking time and reaction time were correlated with self-reported engagement
Source: Correlations between means of these features are respectively 0.866 and 0.881. Mean curves follow similar tendencies.

## acceptance
Answer: Participants reported positive affective states and enjoyment interacting with the robot
Source: Participants feelings were globally positive: participants assessed to have more positive affective states than negative ones during the interaction.

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Emotion detection needs improvement for elderly speech; adaptive behavior enhances engagement; user preferences vary widely
Source: The robot has to adapt its speech velocity and its way to detect emotions... the diversity between user evaluation of robot behavior.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample sizes and the need for age-adapted emotion detection algorithms
Source: The size of the sample does not allow statistically significant results... it is necessary to take into account the age of the user.
