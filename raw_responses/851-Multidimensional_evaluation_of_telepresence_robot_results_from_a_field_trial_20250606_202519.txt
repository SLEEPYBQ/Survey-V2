## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Needs: Improved independence, increased security, support in emergencies. Expectations: Positive impact on communication, ease of use, trust in robot's ability.  
Source: "The proposed telepresence service is a potential solution to improve both the quality of elders' life and the services provided to them... it can support their communication possibilities, promote social inclusion and increase the real, and perceived security."  

## application_context  
Answer: Supporting frail elderly in their homes to live independently and improve social relationships.  
Source: "In this context, a robotic telepresence service could support the frail persons in their homes, empowering their social relationships."  

## testing_context  
Answer: Private homes  
Source: "The proposed protocol is divided into three main phases... the other two (i.e. training in situ and field test) took place at the user's private home."  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: Field test lasted 169 days, with 105 telepresence services delivered, averaging 29 mins per service.  
Source: "At the end of the field trials, which lasted 169 days in total, a total of 105 telepresence services were delivered. The average duration of a single service was equal to 29 mins."  

## methodology  
Answer: Multidimensional questionnaires (acceptance, usability, expectation domains) administered before (T0) and after (TF) field tests.  
Source: "A total of 169 days of field-test trial was evaluated before (TO) and after (TF) the tests with a multidimensional framework, including acceptance, usability, and expectation domains."  

## robot_type  
Answer: Telepresence robot  
Source: "In this work, 10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot (i.e. Double Robot)."  

## robot_name  
Answer: Double Robot  
Source: "In this work, 10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot (i.e. Double Robot)."  

## design_goal  
Answer: To evaluate human factors influencing telepresence service experience and improve elderly independence and social relationships.  
Source: "This paper aims to present and discuss how human factors could influence the potential and the real experience of the telepresence services... to improve both the quality of elders' life and the services provided to them."  

## robot_general_function  
Answer: Remote telepresence for social interaction and monitoring by caregivers.  
Source: "The proposed service allowed the social workers to remote visit the frail seniors at their home, increasing the total number of visits performed in a week."  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Improved communication, increased security, ease of use, trust in robot's ability.  
Source: "The proposed telepresence service... can support their communication possibilities, promote social inclusion and increase the real, and perceived security."  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Privacy concerns, fear of robot, perceived difficulty in communication.  
Source: "Subjects who expected the robot negatively affects their privacy... felt also more embarrassed and nervous using the robot."  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Positive a priori attitude, higher trust, enjoyment, perceived ease of use.  
Source: "A positive a priori attitude is related to more trust towards the robot, more enjoyment in using it, and with the idea that the robot is easy to use."  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Negative bias, fear of robot, anxiety, tension during interaction.  
Source: "Negative bias towards the robot (i.e. to be afraid of the robot) could increase the subjects' anxiety and the tension during the interaction."  

## engagement  
Answer: Positive trend in enjoyment (ENJ-Q6) and trust (TRUST-Q7) after use.  
Source: "After using the robot, people declare to enjoy more than they expected... the TRUST subscale shows an interesting pattern... making real experience with the robot could foster the trust."  

## acceptance  
Answer: Average score of 70.83 at TF (post-test).  
Source: "The mean overall score for the ad-hoc questionnaires... was 61.17 (SD=12.30) at T0 and 70.83 (SD=9.79) at TF."  

## robot_function_effectiveness  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## user_satisfaction  
Answer: Positive trends in perceived ease of use (PEU-Q11) and trust (TRUST-Q7).  
Source: "After using the robot, subjects generally feel more comfortable, confident, and less scared about it."  

## user_curiosity  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## user_trust_reliance  
Answer: Higher trust scores after use (TRUST-Q7).  
Source: "The TRUST subscale shows an interesting pattern... making real experience with the robot could foster the trust."  

## user_understanding  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## learning_curve_productivity  
Answer: Improved perceived ease of use (PEU-Q11) after use.  
Source: "The Wilcoxon test for paired samples on ad-hoc questionnaires show us statistically significant differences between item 11 (the interface usability) at T0 and TF."  

## system_controllability_interaction  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## key_findings  
Answer: Expectation and prejudice influence perceived and real usability/acceptance. Real use improves comfort, confidence, and reduces fear. Positive a priori attitude correlates with higher trust and enjoyment.  
Source: "Expectation and prejudice seem to play a key role, not only in determining the perceived usability/acceptance of a robot but also concerning the real usability and acceptance after the interaction with the robot."  

## additional_info  
Answer: Limitations include small sample size (n=10) and lack of demographic influence analysis.  
Source: "Based on our small sample, it seems that there is no relationship between gender, age, educational level, and family composition in any measurements."
