## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly patients, clinicians, and robotics experts
Source: "The CLARC robot performs three different CGA tests: Barthel, Minimental and Get Up & Go [13]. These tests have different features and their implementation within the CLARC system achieved different degrees of success."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Functional, cognitive, and motion impairments
Source: "The CLARC robot performs three different CGA tests: Barthel, Minimental and Get Up & Go [13]. These tests are a representative example of functional, cognitive and motion CGA procedures, respectively."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Patients prefer the remote control for answering questions; clinicians need robust data collection and time-saving features
Source: "This feedback will be also added to the patient profile and will guide us in the refinement and personalization of the system interfaces."

## application_context
Answer: Hospitals, nursery houses, and day care centers
Source: "CLARC addresses its third and final phase in 2018, which involves long-term tests with real patients in different institutions, including hospitals, nursery houses and day care centers."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Long-term deployment with sessions recorded and reviewed
Source: "The sessions can be started, paused, stopped and monitored in real time, and they are also recorded in video."

## methodology
Answer: User-centered approach with questionnaires, debriefing, and semi-directive interviews
Source: "The system was evaluated using a user-centered approach, in which feedback from users was collected via questionnaires, 20-minutes debriefing and semi-directive interviews [13]."

## care_type
Answer: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)
Source: "The CLARC project aims to develop a socially assistive robot to help clinicians perform Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) procedures."

## robot_type
Answer: Socially assistive robot
Source: "The CLARC project aims to develop a socially assistive robot to help clinicians perform Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) procedures."

## robot_name
Answer: CLARC
Source: "The CLARC project aims to develop a socially assistive robot to help clinicians perform Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) procedures."

## design_goal
Answer: To autonomously drive CGA tests and save clinician time
Source: "This robot autonomously drives some tests and processes, saving time for the clinician to perform more added-value activities, like designing care plans."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Conducting Barthel, Minimental, and Get Up & Go tests
Source: "The CLARC robot performs three different CGA tests: Barthel, Minimental and Get Up & Go [13]."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Remote control for answering questions, autonomous navigation, and session recording
Source: "The remote control will be, by large, the patients' preferred option to provide the answers."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Voice interface not robust enough, some Minimental test questions tiresome
Source: "Although patients are willing to interact with the robot using the voice interface, this module is not robust enough to allow fluent conversations for now."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Familiarity with technology, willingness to interact with the robot
Source: "The elderly generations are becoming quickly familiar with tech usage [7]."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: First-time users may find Get Up & Go test complex
Source: "This kind of test seems to be complex to achieve for people who meet the robot for the first time."

## engagement
Answer: Positive initial impressions but novelty effect may wear off
Source: "Their first impressions have been good (satisfactory usability and acceptability rates in the user tests) but it may be due to the novelty effect."

## acceptance
Answer: High initial acceptance, especially with remote control
Source: "The remote control will be, by large, the patients' preferred option to provide the answers."

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: CLARC is promising for autonomous CGA tests but requires further refinement for long-term acceptance
Source: "Results obtained so far are promising in terms of robustness and utility for the clinician, as long as the robot keeps being used for what it is good for."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include voice interface robustness and partial automation of Minimental test
Source: "The Minimental test is a cognitive test with different types of questions, more open responses, and exercises involving not only answering questions, but also writing, doing movements, drawing, etc [13]. This kind of test resulted to be annoying and tiresome for the patients."

## testing_context
Answer: Hospitals, nursery houses, and day care centers
Source: "CLARC addresses its third and final phase in 2018, which involves long-term tests with real patients in different institutions, including hospitals, nursery houses and day care centers."
