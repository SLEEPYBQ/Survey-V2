The concerns of older adults are increasingly centered on SARs' ability to offer intelligent, secure, and efficient care services that effectively tackle the issues they encounter in their daily lives... The SAR's delightful tone, endearing voice, and adeptness in social interactions contribute to a pleasurable emotional experience for seniors, thereby augmenting its social appeal."

## application_context
Answer: Community/home care for older adults living in the community
Source: "To investigate the acceptance of SARs for older adults living in the community... This quantitative study provides basic information to improve the quality of home care services for older people in Chinese communities"

## process_of_the_care
Answer: First encounter; participants watched an introductory video, had a 30-minute discussion, then completed the questionnaire

## robot_name
Answer: Xiaoyu

## design_goal
Answer: To provide video calling, chatting and escorting, life services, and safety monitoring for older adults

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Video calling, chatting and escorting, life services, safety monitoring
Source: "The main functions are video calling, chatting and escorting, life services and safety monitoring."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Perceived usefulness (value services), perceived enjoyment (entertainment functions such as juggling, dancing, singing, storytelling, news reporting, joke telling), perceived ease of use (simple operation), emotional support, and social interaction features
Source: "The value services offered by SARs were consistent with the utilitarian benefits that older people expect from technological innovation... The SAR's delightful tone, endearing voice, and adeptness in social interactions contribute to a pleasurable emotional experience for seniors, thereby augmenting its social appeal... the primary need of the participants was the entertainment function of the robot (such as juggling, dancing, singing, storytelling, news reporting, joke telling)."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Technological complexity, operational frustration, and anxiety due to low perceived ease of use; lack of familiarity with robots; fear of technology
Source: "Studies have found that older adults have anxiety about new technologies and that, in addition to their own physiological reasons, technological complexity reduces the level of perceived ease of use, leading to operational frustration and anxiety, which hinders their acceptance of SARs... SARs are not a prevalent occurrence in the lives of elderly individuals in China, and the concept of robots is a novelty to the majority of this demographic. Moreover, studies have indicated that a significant proportion of older people in China harbor apprehensions about using technological products and show fear of technology."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Experience with mobile service devices, positive attitude, higher perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use, higher self-efficacy, extraversion personality
Source: "The results showed that whether to use mobile devices(smartphones, computers, robots), attitude, perceived enjoyment perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use were influential factors in the intention to use (p<0.05)... Intention to use was positively correlated with attitude to use, perceived adaptivity, perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use, trust, self-efficacy, and extraversion personality"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Older age, lack of experience with mobile devices, technophobia, anxiety about new technologies, diminished memory and visual acuity, physiological decline
Source: "It was negatively correlated with age (r=0.155, P<0.05)... elderly's diminishing memory and visual acuity, resulting in their decreased reliance on artificial intelligence and mobile internet devices... elderly users exhibit lower levels of engagement and are less likely to utilize services offered by these technologies... they may experience technical anxiety or exhibit resistance towards emerging technologies"

## engagement
Answer: Moderate engagement; mean willingness to use score 2.55 ± 0.86 (on a 5-point scale), described as neutral attitude and lower engagement compared to other studies
Source: "In this study the mean score of the community elderly willingness to use entries was (2.55 § 0.86), which is close to the results of Backonja et al. study, maintaining a neutral attitude towards SARs... elderly users exhibit lower levels of engagement and are less likely to utilize services offered by these technologies."

## acceptance
Answer: Moderate acceptance; acceptance rate 51.0%
Source: "the acceptance of the SAR technology was calculated to be 51.0%... The results showed that the technology acceptance of SARs among older adults was 51.0%"

## trust
Answer: Trust score mean 3.53 ± 0.72 (on a 5-point scale); trust positively correlated with intention to use
Source: "Trust                 | 7.06§1.45  | 3.53§0.72 ... Intention to use was positively correlated with ... trust"

## key_findings
Answer: Acceptance of SARs among Chinese community-dwelling older adults is moderate (51.0%) and mainly influenced by perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use, experience with mobile devices, and attitude; perceived usefulness is the primary factor; regional culture impacts acceptance; involving older adults in design and training may improve acceptance.
Source: "The results showed that the acceptance rate of the community elderly to SARs was 51%. Perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use, whether to use mobile devices (smartphones, computers, robots) and attitude are the main factors affecting the acceptance of SARs. In addition, perceived usefulness was the primary factor, followed by perceived enjoyment... encouraging the involvement of older people and caregivers in the design of SARs, enhancing the value of use, reducing operational difficulties and personalizing SARs to the needs of older people will be key points in increasing the acceptance of SARs among older people in China."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include relatively small sample size, participants only from Changsha City, and only preliminary exploration of influencing factors; further studies with larger and more diverse samples are needed.
Source: "The present study had some limitations. First, the sample size used in the current study was relatively small. Second, participants only comprised community-dwelling elderly people living in Changsha City. In addition, this study only preliminary explored the influencing factors, and the interaction was not further analyzed. Further studies with a larger sample size comprising participants recruited from multiple institutions should be conducted to validate these findings."
