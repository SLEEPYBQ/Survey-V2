## sample_size
Answer: 109 older adults (52 in the experimental group, 57 in the comparison group)
Source: "A quasiexperimental research design was adopted with 109 older adults from 8 long-term care facilities and day-care centers assigned to the experimental (n = 52) and comparison groups (n = 57)."

## country
Answer: Taiwan
Source: "We received administrative support and approached 27 long-term care facilities and day-care centers in northern Taiwan."

## age
Answer: Mean age 82.56 (SD = 7.88) for experimental group, 81.44 (SD = 7.43) for comparison group
Source: "The mean age and standard deviation (SD) of the experimental and comparison groups were 82.56 (SD = 7.88) and 81.44 (SD = 7.43), respectively."

## gender
Answer: Experimental group - 28.85% male, 71.15% female; Comparison group - 31.58% male, 68.42% female
Source: "Male: 15 (28.85%), Female: 37 (71.15%) in experimental group; Male: 18 (31.58%), Female: 39 (68.42%) in comparison group."

## demographic_background
Answer: Education level (≤9 years: 61.54% experimental, 50.88% comparison; >9 years: 38.46% experimental, 49.12% comparison), partner status, board game experience, comorbidities (high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, cardiovascular diseases)
Source: Table 2 shows demographic variables including education, partner status, board game experience, and comorbidities.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Mild cognitive impairment (MMSE scores 18-23)
Source: "The selection criteria for participating were (1) residents with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores from 18 to 23."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs include improving cognitive function, general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and reducing depression. Expectations include engaging in cooperative gameplay and social interaction.
Source: "Our findings support the effectiveness of robot-assisted board games targeting older adults with MCI to improve their cognitive function, general self-efficacy, satisfaction with life, and depression."

## application_context
Answer: Long-term care facilities and day-care centers
Source: "The training occurred in the long-term care facility (LTC) where the residents live."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 12 once-weekly 60-minute sessions over 3 months
Source: "The experimental group underwent 3 months of robot-assisted board game training, that is, 12 once-weekly 60-minute sessions."

## methodology
Answer: Cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up measurements
Source: "A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted, following the CONSORT extension guidelines."

## care_type
Answer: Cognitive training for mild cognitive impairment
Source: "The effectiveness of robot-assisted board games targeting older adults with mild cognitive impairment was investigated to improve their cognitive function."

## robot_type
Answer: Child-like robot
Source: "The small, easy-to-operate, child-like robots made cognitive training engaging."

## robot_name
Answer: Kebbi
Source: "Players scan the QR codes on the cards to trigger the robot to display questions or training tasks... a robot named Kebbi."

## design_goal
Answer: To improve cognitive function, general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and reduce depression among older adults with MCI
Source: "The effectiveness of robot-assisted board games targeting older adults with mild cognitive impairment was investigated to improve their cognitive function, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction and reduce depression."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Interactive gameplay, question display, feedback provision, and cooperative gameplay facilitation
Source: "Players scan the QR codes on the cards to trigger the robot to display questions or training tasks. Players who answer correctly receive reward points, whereas incorrect answers elicit encouragement from the robot to try again."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Cooperative gameplay, social interaction, feedback and praise from the robot, and familiarization with question patterns
Source: "Players are encouraged to cooperate to answer questions or complete cognitive training tasks... participants received feedback and praise from the robot and group members."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher cognitive capabilities, familiarity with robot operations, and social interaction during gameplay
Source: "The authors suggested that older people with higher cognitive capabilities engaged more actively than those with lower capabilities."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Lower cognitive capabilities, lack of familiarity with robots, and hand movement inconveniences
Source: "Older people with inconvenient hand movements, inability to operate robots, and inability to understand instructions or execute actions based on instructions were also excluded from the study."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement indicated by high System Usability Scale (SUS) score (87.50)
Source: "The mean SUS score was 87.50 – 4.61, which indicates that the participants found the system usable."

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance as indicated by the high SUS score and positive feedback
Source: "The high SUS scores support the feasibility of conducting robot-assisted interventions among older adult populations."

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development through repeated interactions and positive feedback
Source: "Participants had the opportunity to answer their questions and observe each other responding, which helped them gain vicarious experience."

## key_findings
Answer: Significant improvements in cognitive function, general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and reduction in depression, with effects persisting at 3-month follow-up
Source: "The GEE analyses revealed significant postintervention improvements in the experimental group's MMSE, ADAS-Cog, depression, general self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life scores. These effects persisted for the 3-month follow-up."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include inability to distinguish between group or individual interaction effects and lack of RCT design
Source: "First, it could not distinguish between intervention efficacy resulting from group or individual interactions... Second, the study did not apply an RCT design."

## testing_context
Answer: Long-term care facilities and day-care centers in northern Taiwan
Source: "The training occurred in the long-term care facility (LTC) where the residents live."
