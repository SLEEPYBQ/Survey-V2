## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Emotional care through affective support, natural and human-like interactions
Source: This study focuses on social robots that interact with elderly individuals and provide them with emotional care through affective support [...] The objective of this study is to develop an optimized set of robot facial expressions and gestures that can enable robots to express emotions in a manner similar to humans.

## application_context
Answer: Emotional care for elderly individuals in daily interactions
Source: This study focuses on social robots that interact with elderly individuals and provide them with emotional care through affective support [...] We constructed an integrated scenario of the interactions between social robots and humans featuring the elderly, from the time they wake up in the morning to the time they go to bed.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use with specific interaction sessions
Source: The study involved group interviews, preference evaluations, and validation evaluations, but the duration and frequency of interactions are not explicitly stated.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative group interviews, quantitative surveys, preference evaluations, motion capture analysis
Source: We conducted group interviews using a mood meter [...] we conducted surveys and user preference evaluations [...] we collected and analyzed human facial expression images using the Facial Action Coding System [...] we collected and evaluated human gesture videos [...] motion capture technology.

## care_type
Answer: Emotional care
Source: This study focuses on social robots that interact with elderly individuals and provide them with emotional care through affective support.

## robot_type
Answer: Social robot with 2D display face and upper body movements
Source: The majority of commercially available robots express facial expressions through the use of either two-dimensional (2D) displays or three-dimensional (3D) actuators, with a full-face 2D display being the most common [...] we focused on upper body movements.

## robot_name
Answer: N/A

## design_goal
Answer: To develop natural and human-like facial expressions and gestures for emotional interaction
Source: The objective of this study is to develop an optimized set of robot facial expressions and gestures that can enable robots to express emotions in a manner similar to humans. Through this, we aim to facilitate robot interactions that foster natural emotional connections with users.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Facial expressions and gestures for six emotions (Loving, Joyful, Upbeat, Hopeful, Concerned, Grateful)
Source: As a result of the study, we developed facial expression and gesture designs for six emotions (Loving, Joyful, Upbeat, Hopeful, Concerned, Grateful) in social robots interacting with elderly individuals.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Human-like facial expressions and gestures enhance emotional connection and user comfort
Source: As posited by Li et al., humans tend to exhibit a heightened sense of proximity and affinity toward robots that exhibit behaviors analogous to those observed in humans, including gestures, facial expressions, and emotional states.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Simplistic and mechanical facial expressions and gestures hinder emotional understanding
Source: The facial expressions and gestures of modern social robots are often simplistic and mechanical in nature, hindering their ability to convey emotions accurately.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Elderly users prefer geometric and simplified facial designs
Source: The Type B face design, characterized by geometric eyes and other components, achieved the highest mean score (5.55).

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Overly exaggerated facial expressions and unnatural gestures reduce acceptance
Source: The users indicated that the facial expressions were overly exaggerated compared to the gestures [...] the gestures lacked sufficient expression of concern or anxiety.

## engagement
Answer: High engagement through natural emotional expressions
Source: The results provide guidelines for designing human-friendly robot facial expressions and gestures, thus enabling social robots to form deep emotional bonds with users.

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance after design refinements based on user feedback
Source: Following the presentation of the revised gesture designs, the participants indicated their preferences on a seven-point scale. For all designs, the average score was 5.5 or higher.

## trust
Answer: Emotional expressions foster trust and familiarity
Source: This can enable the transition of robots from mere tools to companions that inspire trust and familiarity.

## key_findings
Answer: Developed facial expression and gesture designs for six emotions, validated through user evaluations
Source: As a result of the study, we developed facial expression and gesture designs for six emotions (Loving, Joyful, Upbeat, Hopeful, Concerned, Grateful) in social robots interacting with elderly individuals.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include lack of emotional intensity variations and cultural differences
Source: This study is constrained by the fact that it presents a single facial expression and gesture for each emotion, which does not account for the potential variations in emotional intensity [...] emotional expressions can vary in interpretation and application depending on cultural differences and individual characteristics.

## testing_context
Answer: Lab setting with video presentations and group interviews
Source: A total of 25 potential elderly users were presented with a video of the HRI design [...] Ten elderly individuals [...] participated in the group interviews.
