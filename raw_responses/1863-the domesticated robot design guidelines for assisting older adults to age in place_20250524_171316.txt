## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Older adults aged 65-93, caregivers (implied but not directly mentioned), and robotics researchers
Source: We conducted five structured group interviews, with each group comprised of two to five independently living older adults (N = 21) between the ages of 65 and 93

## sample_size
Answer: 21 older adults
Source: We conducted five structured group interviews, with each group comprised of two to five independently living older adults (N = 21)

## country
Answer: United States (metro Atlanta area)
Source: Participants were recruited from local senior centers and retirement homes in metro Atlanta

## age
Answer: Ages 65-93 (Mean=80.25 years, SD=7.19)
Source: between the ages of 65 and 93 (M=80.25 years, SD = 7.19)

## gender
Answer: Not explicitly stated in the paper
Source: Not found in the paper

## demographic_background
Answer: 66.7% lived in senior housing, 28.5% in house/apartment/condo, 4.8% in relative's home; 33.4% had less than college education, 38.1% some college, 28.5% post-graduate training; 57.7% White/Caucasian, 42.9% Black/African American
Source: Most participants lived in an independent residence in senior housing (66.7%) or in a house, apartment, or condominium (28.5%), whereas the remainder lived in a relative's home (4.8%)... 33.4% had less than formal college education, 38.1% had some college, and 28.5% had at least some post graduate training... 57.7% White/Caucasian and 42.9% Black/African American

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Participants were independently living and relatively healthy; no specific impairment measures reported
Source: We interviewed independently living older adults who reported themselves to be relatively healthy

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Older adults preferred robot assistance for cleaning and fetching/organizing tasks; benefits included compensating for limitations, saving time/effort, completing undesirable tasks; concerns included potential damage, unreliability, dependency, and space limitations
Source: Older adults reported benefits of robot assistance (e.g., the robot compensating for limitations, saving them time and effort, completing undesirable tasks, and performing tasks at a high level of performance). Participants also reported concerns such as the robot damaging the environment, being unreliable at or incapable of doing a task, doing tasks the older adult would rather do, or taking up too much space/storage

## application_context
Answer: Home environment to support aging in place
Source: Design Guidelines for Assisting Older Adults to Age in Place

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Not applicable (study involved group interviews and questionnaires, not long-term care)
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Structured group interviews and questionnaires
Source: We administered questionnaires and conducted structured group interviews with 21 independently living older adults

## care_type
Answer: Home upkeep and maintenance tasks
Source: Challenges in performing home upkeep tasks threaten an older adult's ability to age in place

## robot_type
Answer: Mobile manipulator robot with two arms/grippers, telescoping spine, and pan-tilt head
Source: The PR2 is a commercially available mobile manipulator that is currently used by a number of robotics researchers. This robot has an omni-directional wheeled base with two 8 DOF arms/grippers, a telescoping spine, and a pan-tilt head that carries two stereo camera pairs and a LED texture projector

## robot_name
Answer: PR2 (Personal Robot 2)
Source: The robot depicted in this study was the PR2 (Personal Robot 2)

## design_goal
Answer: To meet older adults' needs for home upkeep assistance and increase acceptance
Source: However, for home robots to be adopted by older adult users, they must be designed to meet older adults' needs for assistance and the older users must be amenable to robot assistance for those needs

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Cleaning tasks (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, floors) and fetching/organizing objects
Source: The questionnaire data suggest that older adults prefer robot assistance for cleaning and fetching/organizing tasks overall

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Compensation for limitations, time/effort saving, performing undesirable tasks, high performance level
Source: Older adults reported benefits of robot assistance (e.g., the robot compensating for limitations, saving them time and effort, completing undesirable tasks, and performing tasks at a high level of performance)

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Potential environmental damage, unreliability, dependency concerns, space/storage limitations
Source: Participants also reported concerns such as the robot damaging the environment, being unreliable at or incapable of doing a task, doing tasks the older adult would rather do, or taking up too much space/storage

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Openness to technology, recognition of robot benefits, desire for independence
Source: "I think the robot for me is an amenity that enhances quality of life." "It [the robot] would give that person a certain amount of independence in being in more control of their life."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Fear of dependency, limited mental model of robot capabilities, concerns about space
Source: "Well, con. If it makes you dependent." "I keep thinking of it in terms of how it could help prepare my food but I don't know whether robots could cook." "Storage issues... [It] takes some space."

## engagement
Answer: Not explicitly measured quantitatively; qualitative reports of interest in robot assistance
Source: The questionnaire data suggest that older adults prefer robot assistance for cleaning and fetching/organizing tasks overall

## acceptance
Answer: Mixed acceptance depending on task type; generally positive for cleaning/fetching tasks
Source: Collapsed across all tasks participants did not have a preference for human or robot assistance (M=2.99; SD=0.42). However, when each task was analyzed individually, histograms indicated preferences differed between tasks

## trust
Answer: Concerns about reliability and capability, but no direct trust measures reported
Source: "You tell him to bring glasses, he brings you a pair of shoes." "And also if there is a malfunction on this robot. Some warning that let you know that something is wrong"

## key_findings
Answer: Older adults prefer robot assistance for cleaning/fetching tasks; design recommendations include customizability, collaboration, manipulation capabilities, payload capacity, range of motion, and compact size
Source: These data, along with specific comments from participant interviews, provide the basis for preliminary recommendations for designing mobile manipulator robots to support aging in place

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, single geographic location, and focus on healthy older adults
Source: The next step in this line of research would be to investigate older adults' opinions of seeing the robot in person, length of engagement, or robot assistance for older adults with impairments

## testing_context
Answer: Senior centers and retirement homes in metro Atlanta
Source: Participants were recruited from local senior centers and retirement homes. The structured group interviews were conducted at the recruitment locations
