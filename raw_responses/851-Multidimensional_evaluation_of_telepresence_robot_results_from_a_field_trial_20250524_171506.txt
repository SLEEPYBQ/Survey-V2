## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals aged over 60, formal caregivers, and technical solution providers
Source: "10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot (i.e. Double Robot), through which the formal caregiver could remotely visit and chat with them."

## sample_size
Answer: 10 elderly participants
Source: "At the end of the recruitment process, a total of ten older adults accepted to be involved in the field trial."

## country
Answer: Italy
Source: "The recruitment process was conducted by Pane & Rose social cooperative, which was involved in the CloudIA project, founded by Tuscany Region."

## age
Answer: 75.10 ± 16.48 years old
Source: "At the end of the recruitment process, a total of ten older adults accepted to be involved in the field trial (aged: 75.10 ± 16.48 years old)."

## gender
Answer: 4 male, 6 female
Source: "Four of them were male, and six participants were female."

## demographic_background
Answer: Marital status (1 married, 5 widowed, others not married), living situation (2 lived alone, others with relatives), educational level (5 elementary school, 4 middle school, 1 higher level)
Source: "One person was married, five persons were widowed, and the remaining were not married. Two persons lived alone, and the others lived with relatives. As concerns the educational level, five persons attended the elementary school, four persons the middle school, and the remaining had a higher educational level."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for increased independence, improved social relationships, and perceived safety; expectations included ease of use and trust in the robot's functionality
Source: "The results underline good usability- and acceptance- related domains (average score equals to 70.83 at TF) and expectation (average score equal to 67.01 at TF)."

## application_context
Answer: Private homes for elderly individuals to support independent living and social relationships
Source: "In this context, a robotic telepresence service could support the frail persons in their homes, empowering their social relationships."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Field test trial lasting 169 days, with caregivers calling users remotely; session duration averaged 29 minutes
Source: "At the end of the field trials, which lasted 169 days in total, a total of 105 telepresence services were delivered. The average duration of a single service was equal to 29 mins."

## methodology
Answer: Multidimensional questionnaires administered before (T0) and after (TF) the field test, including acceptance, usability, and expectation domains
Source: "A total of 169 days of field-test trial was evaluated before (TO) and after (TF) the tests with a multidimensional framework, including acceptance, usability, and expectation domains."

## care_type
Answer: Telepresence service for social support and remote monitoring
Source: "The proposed telepresence service is a potential solution to improve both the quality of elders' life and the services provided to them."

## robot_type
Answer: Telepresence robot
Source: "The Double robot is a trade product designed by Double Robotics (Burlingame, California)."

## robot_name
Answer: Double Robot
Source: "10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot (i.e. Double Robot)."

## design_goal
Answer: To support independent living and improve social relationships for elderly individuals
Source: "The proposed telepresence service is a potential solution to improve both the quality of elders' life and the services provided to them."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Remote telepresence, social interaction, and monitoring
Source: "The proposed telepresence service allowed the social workers to remote visit the frail seniors at their home, increasing the total number of visits performed in a week."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Easy-to-use interface, improved social interaction, and perceived safety
Source: "The results underline good usability- and acceptance- related domains (average score equals to 70.83 at TF) and expectation (average score equal to 67.01 at TF)."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Privacy concerns and initial fear of the robot
Source: "Subjects who expected the robot negatively affects their privacy (expectation item 1), their independence (expectation item 6), and their safety (PES) felt also more embarrassed (ANX-Q4) and nervous (ANX-Q5) using the robot."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Positive attitude towards technology, higher trust in the robot, and enjoyment in using it
Source: "A positive *a priori* attitude is related to more trust towards the robot, more enjoyment in using it, and with the idea that the robot is easy to use."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Negative bias towards the robot, anxiety, and tension during interaction
Source: "Negative bias towards the robot (i.e. to be afraid of the robot) could increase the subjects' anxiety and the tension during the interaction."

## engagement
Answer: Positive trend in engagement after use, with increased enjoyment and ease of use
Source: "After using the robot, people declare to enjoy more than they expected."

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance scores (average 70.83 at TF), influenced by positive expectations
Source: "The results underline good usability- and acceptance- related domains (average score equals to 70.83 at TF)."

## trust
Answer: Increased trust after use, with higher scores in perceived safety and ease of use
Source: "After using the robot, subjects generally feel more comfortable, confident, and less scared about it."

## key_findings
Answer: Expectations influence usability and acceptance; real experience improves trust and reduces fear; positive trends in usability and enjoyment after use
Source: "Results remark that expectation could influence the potential and the real use of the robot. Additionally, a positive trend in the answers was identified between T0 and TF."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size and lack of demographic influence on results
Source: "Based on our small sample, it seems that there is no relationship between gender, age, educational level, and family composition in any measurements."

## testing_context
Answer: Private homes of elderly participants
Source: "The proposed protocol is divided into three main phases as depicted in Figure 1. In the first part of the experimental protocol, the engineers trained the social workers to the use of the Double robot and to install it in a private home."
