## age
Answer: 39 to 88 years old
Source: Twenty patients participated in this study. There were 14 women and six men who presented to this study between 39 and 88 years old.

## gender
Answer: 14 women and 6 men
Source: Twenty patients participated in this study. There were 14 women and six men who presented to this study between 39 and 88 years old.

## demographic_background
Answer: Patients with dementia (primary progressive aphasia, Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, and Vascular disease)
Source: They were affected by one or multiple types of dementia: primary progressive aphasia, Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, and Vascular disease.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Dementia (measured by Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE scores ranged from 14 to 27)
Source: According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), this scale is commonly used in diagnosing dementia. This value is calculated from a written test. The maximum score is 30, and low scores indicate severe cognitive problems.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Therapists and psychologists highly valued the inclusion of a social robot in healthcare environments to make patients' day-to-day lives more dynamic and to record game results for assessing disease evolution.
Source: The therapists and psychologists of the CREA of Salamanca highly valued the objectives of this research. They considered that including a social robot in a healthcare environment could make patients' day-to-day lives more dynamic.

## application_context
Answer: Therapies for people with dementia in healthcare environments
Source: This document presents a methodology to carry out robot acceptance tests applied in therapies with dementia patients.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use with sessions lasting 8–10 minutes
Source: The total duration of the test is 8–10 min, being observed and recorded from the neighboring room through the one-way mirror.

## methodology
Answer: Observational study using a Likert-scale questionnaire filled by experts based on patient interactions with the robot
Source: The main assessment instrument was a 20 item questionnaire based on Likert-scale questions. This scale has been validated to be used in questionnaires that measure psycho-social aspects.

## care_type
Answer: Cognitive therapy for dementia patients
Source: The robot proposes to play a game, and the Knowledge game, described above, begins. The therapist can help the patient by repeating the questions that (s)he does not understand.

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid robot
Source: We have used a humanoid robot Pepper. This robot is commonly used in social robotics, and is available worldwide at an affordable price given its characteristics.

## robot_name
Answer: Pepper
Source: We have used a humanoid robot Pepper. This robot is commonly used in social robotics, and is available worldwide at an affordable price given its characteristics.

## design_goal
Answer: To evaluate the suitability of a robot during therapy sessions and measure patient rejection based on observational data
Source: The proposed test focuses on evaluating the suitability of a robot during therapy sessions. The test measures the rejection of the robot by the patient based on observational data.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Interaction through voice, touch screen, movement, and games (Knowledge, Logic, and Memory games)
Source: The robot will use its voice to address the patient to give instructions or to ask questions. The robot will be able to perform choreographies that include movements and music. The patient will communicate with the robot mainly through the tablet on its chest.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Voice interaction, touch screen interaction, movement, and games (Knowledge, Logic, and Memory games)
Source: The robot will use its voice to address the patient to give instructions or to ask questions. The robot will be able to perform choreographies that include movements and music. The patient will communicate with the robot mainly through the tablet on its chest.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Poor touch screen responsiveness and synthetic voice clarity
Source: The score in the dialogue section is correlated with the score in most of the other sections, except for the Memory game. The Touch Interaction is also correlated with the rest of the test scores.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher MMSE scores (better cognitive abilities) correlated with better acceptance of the robot
Source: Figure 10 presents that, as the value of MMSE increases, the six aspects of our questionnaire also increase, it means that when the cognitive capacities of the individual are better, also the perception of each aspect is better.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Lower MMSE scores (worse cognitive abilities) correlated with lower acceptance of the robot
Source: These results also lead us to think that the approach for performing games with the platform had to be revisited, in particular the Memory Game.

## engagement
Answer: High engagement observed in most aspects (mean scores above 4 in Contact, Static Affinity, Dynamic Affinity, Perceived Sociability, and games)
Source: The rest of the test scores are high (greater than 4), with the maximum score being the most common of all the test sections.

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance observed in most aspects (mean scores above 4 in Contact, Static Affinity, Dynamic Affinity, Perceived Sociability, and games)
Source: The rest of the test scores are high (greater than 4), with the maximum score being the most common of all the test sections.

## trust
Answer: High trust observed in most aspects (mean scores above 4 in Contact, Static Affinity, Dynamic Affinity, Perceived Sociability, and games)
Source: The rest of the test scores are high (greater than 4), with the maximum score being the most common of all the test sections.

## key_findings
Answer: The test is feasible for evaluating robot acceptance in dementia patients, avoiding questionnaires. High acceptance was observed in most aspects, but touch screen and voice interaction need improvement.
Source: The results show that this test is feasible in this type of evaluation, avoiding questionnaires for patients who find it challenging to carry out.

## additional_info
Answer: Therapists recommended modifying the robot's voice to higher pitches and improving touch screen responsiveness.
Source: Therapists and psychologists recommended modifying the robot's voice to higher pitches in order to be better understood.
