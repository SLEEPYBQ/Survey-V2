## robot_concern_function
Answer: Displaying questions or training tasks via QR code scanning, providing feedback (reward points, encouragement), facilitating cooperative gameplay, and supporting cognitive training in six domains (orientation, memory, oral understanding and behavioral ability, constructive ability, attention and calculation, language skills).
Source: "Players scan the QR codes on the cards to trigger the robot to display questions or training tasks. Players who answer correctly receive reward points, whereas incorrect answers elicit encouragement from the robot to try again."; "six topics were developed for the board game, including orientation (people, time, and place), attention and calculation, shortterm memory (recall), language skills, ability to understand and follow instructions, and visuospatial abilities..."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Cooperative gameplay, personalized and adaptable experience, positive feedback and praise from the robot, gamification elements (reward points, appreciation), and usability (high SUS score).
Source: "Players' feedback indicates that cooperative gameplay, rather than competition, improves depression and life satisfaction."; "After passing the question challenges, participants received feedback and praise from the robot and group members, which may have strengthened their positive affection..."; "Gamification could increase user motivation and enhance engagement during the learning process."; "The mean SUS score was 87.50 – 4.61, which indicates that the participants found the system usable."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher cognitive capabilities are associated with more active engagement; willingness to participate in group activities; ability to comply with verbal instructions; prior experience with board games (though most had none).
Source: "The authors suggested that older people with higher cognitive capabilities engaged more actively than those with lower capabilities."; "The selection criteria for participating were ... individuals' willingness to comply with verbal instructions..."; "Most participants, with a mean age of over 80 years, had never played with a robot."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe chronic diseases, inconvenient hand movements, inability to operate robots, inability to understand or follow instructions, and unwillingness to participate or fill out questionnaires were associated with non-participation or dropout.
Source: "older people with inconvenient hand movements, inability to operate robots, and inability to understand instructions or execute actions based on instructions were also excluded from the study."; "Common reasons for refusal included lack of time to participate in 12 activities, unwillingness to continue cognitive training for 12 weeks, unwillingness to fill out questionnaires, and concerns about poor performance in the board games."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement, as indicated by high system usability (mean SUS score 87.50) and sustained participation over 12 sessions; cooperative gameplay encouraged sustained participation.
Source: "The mean SUS score was 87.50 – 4.61, which indicates that the participants found the system usable."; "cooperative gameplay... improves depression and life satisfaction"; "providing a personalized, adaptable experience that encourages sustained participation."

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance, as evidenced by high SUS scores and positive feedback; participants found the system usable and feasible.
Source: "The mean SUS score was 87.50 – 4.61, which indicates that the participants found the system usable."; "Most participants, with a mean age of over 80 years, had never played with a robot. However, the high SUS scores support the feasibility of conducting robot-assisted interventions among older adult populations."

## trust
Answer: Trust is implied by high usability and acceptance; participants gradually familiarized themselves with the robot's operations and question patterns, affording a sense of mastery.
Source: "The experimental group participants underwent 12 cognitive training sessions and gradually familiarized themselves with the robot's operations and question patterns, thus affording a sense of mastery."

## key_findings
Answer: Robot-assisted board games significantly improved cognitive function, general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and reduced depression among older adults with mild cognitive impairment; effects persisted at 3-month follow-up; high usability and feasibility were demonstrated.
Source: "The GEE analyses revealed significant postintervention improvements in the experimental group's MMSE, ADAS-Cog, depression, general self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life scores. These effects persisted for the 3-month follow-up. The mean SUS score was 87.50, indicating the feasibility of robot-assisted interventions among older adults. These findings confirmed that interactive robot-assisted board games can improve cognitive function, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction and reduce depression among older adults."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include inability to distinguish between group and individual effects, lack of RCT design for external generalizability, and challenges due to COVID-19; future studies should consider social support components and more diverse groups.
Source: "The study encountered several limitations. First, it could not distinguish between intervention efficacy resulting from group or individual interactions. The research findings must be interpreted with caution. Second, the study did not apply an RCT design, which allows external generalizability. Similar future studies adopt an RCT design... During the third measurement, several participants in the comparison group declined to complete the third measurement since they had not received interventions and had twice completed the same questionnaire. This caused disparities between the experimental and comparison groups at the third assessment."

## testing_context
Answer: Long-term care facilities and day-care centers in northern Taiwan
Source: "A quasiexperimental research design was adopted with 109 older adults from 8 long-term care facilities and day-care centers..."; "The training occurred in the long-term care facility (LTC) where the residents live."
