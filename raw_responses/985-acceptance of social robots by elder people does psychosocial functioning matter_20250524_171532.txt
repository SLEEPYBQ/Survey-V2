## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals aged 65+, caregivers, and robotics experts
Source: A random sample of N = 31 participants was recruited from the "University of the Third Age" located at the Goethe-University of Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

## sample_size
Answer: 29 elderly participants
Source: Finally, the sample consisted of N = 29 participants.

## country
Answer: Germany
Source: A random sample of N = 31 participants was recruited from the "University of the Third Age" located at the Goethe-University of Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

## age
Answer: Median age was 70.00 years (age range 65–81 years)
Source: Median age was Mdn = 70.00 years (age range 65–81 years).

## gender
Answer: Most participants were female (n = 23; 79%)
Source: Most participants were female (n = 23; 79%).

## demographic_background
Answer: Most participants had taken the German Abitur (equals A-levels; n = 17; 59%). Participants perceived themselves as being in good health and very high in independence.
Source: Most participants had taken the German Abitur (equals A-levels; n = 17; 59%). Participants perceived themselves as being in good health [Mdn = 3.00 (scale range 1.00–5.00)] and very high in independence [Mdn = 10.00 (scale range 0.00–10.00)].

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Participants were cognitively and physically healthy.
Source: Elder people were eligible for participation when they were at least 65 years old and reported good cognitive and physical health.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly people expected robots to fulfill social and psychological needs, but some raised concerns about robots being surrogates for personal visits.
Source: Moreover, in the introductory session, many of the study participants raised concerns that Giraff could be used as a surrogate for personal visits and contribute to a loss of unmediated contact.

## application_context
Answer: Home-based care settings for Giraff and nursing homes/formal care settings for Paro.
Source: The mobile remote telepresence robot Giraff is most often utilized in home-based care settings. The companion-type therapeutic robot Paro is most often utilized in nursing homes and other formal care settings.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: The study involved a first encounter with the robots, with individual data assessment sessions.
Source: To avoid convergence of participants' opinions on the robots, as could be expected in group settings, individual data assessment sessions were conducted for each participant.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys
Source: The data presented here was assessed as part of a comprehensive project on the acceptance of social robots by different stakeholders involved in elder care.

## care_type
Answer: Social and psychological support
Source: Social robots have been developed to support the fulfillment of social and psychological needs.

## robot_type
Answer: Therapeutic robot (Paro) and telepresence robot (Giraff)
Source: Two commercially available social robots, Giraff and Paro, were used in this study.

## robot_name
Answer: Paro and Giraff
Source: Two commercially available social robots, Giraff and Paro, were used in this study.

## design_goal
Answer: Paro was designed to elicit positive emotional reactions and social behavior; Giraff was designed to enable remote social contact.
Source: Mimicking a real animal, the seal-shaped robot is explicitly designed to elicit positive emotional reactions in its users. The mobile remote telepresence robot Giraff allows for remote social contact over longer distances.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Paro: elicits social behavior and rewards affection; Giraff: enables video conferencing and remote navigation.
Source: It is programmed to attract the users' attention, to elicit social behavior and to reward affection with positive reactions. Giraff allows for remote social contact over longer distances and can be navigated about in the elder user's home by a "visitor".

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Paro's intuitive handling and positive emotional reactions; Giraff's remote social contact.
Source: Paro needs no additional instructions for its handling, and its embodiment and functions are explicitly aimed at eliciting positive feelings. Giraff fosters feelings of safety and belonging by enabling or facilitating remote human–human interaction.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Giraff's less intuitive handling and anxiety-evoking features; Paro's perceived stigmatization.
Source: Giraff requires additional instruction for its handling and was perceived as less intuitive. Participants indicated significantly higher anxiety in the interaction with Giraff than with Paro. The use of Paro may have been perceived as stigmatizing.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Lower social support was associated with higher acceptance of Giraff in high everyday functioning scenarios.
Source: Results show that lower social support was associated with higher acceptance of the less intuitive robot Giraff in the high everyday functioning scenario.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Lower psychological well-being was associated with lower acceptance of Giraff in low everyday functioning scenarios.
Source: In the low everyday functioning scenario (poor fit), however, lower psychological well-being was associated with lower acceptance of Giraff.

## engagement
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## acceptance
Answer: Intention to use was higher for Paro than Giraff, and higher in low everyday functioning scenarios.
Source: Intention to use Paro was significantly lower in the high than in the low everyday functioning scenario. Intention to use Giraff was significantly lower in the high than in the low everyday functioning scenario.

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Psychosocial functioning influences robot acceptance depending on user-technology fit. Lower social support increased Giraff acceptance in high-functioning scenarios, while lower psychological well-being decreased acceptance in low-functioning scenarios.
Source: The findings show the importance of psychosocial variables for the acceptance of social robots by elder people and underline the relevance of the fit between user and technology.

## additional_info
Answer: Study limitations include a healthy sample, high education level, and single assessment of robot acceptance.
Source: As a result of the demands imposed on participants by the study design, only healthy elder people living independently were included in this study. The generalizability of the study results is further limited by participants' average level of education being higher in this study than in elder German people in general.

## testing_context
Answer: Individual data assessment sessions at the Goethe University.
Source: Individual data assessment sessions were conducted for each participant at the Goethe University of Frankfurt/Main, Germany.
