## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI), caregivers, and robotics experts
Source: The RAMCIP robot, focusing on the elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI), had to accomplish the medication intake scenario.

## sample_size
Answer: 12 elderly participants
Source: The framework and the subordinate methods described in this paper for the assistance provision in the medication adherence scenario have been evaluated with the RAMCIP robot with 12 real participants diagnosed with MCI.

## country
Answer: Spain
Source: The experiments took place in their own home environment, all located in Barcelona, Spain.

## demographic_background
Answer: Elderly individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI) living in their own homes
Source: The experiments took place in their own home environment, all located in Barcelona, Spain.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI)
Source: The RAMCIP robot, focusing on the elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI), had to accomplish the medication intake scenario.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Assistance in medication adherence, reminders, monitoring, and fetching medication
Source: The robot should be aware of the medication schedule of the user; provide reminders to the user through the communication modalities before a medication session; be able to locate, detect and fetch the pill box; monitor and assess the progress of the medication adherence activity.

## application_context
Answer: Domestic environments for elderly individuals with MCI
Source: The ultimate goal of this paper is to provide solutions in a series of perception, cognition and action problems that will enable, in the near future, assistive robots' deployment in real home environments.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Long-term deployment with at least seven days of interaction per participant
Source: Each participant had the opportunity to interact with the robot for at least seven days.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys, and experimental trials
Source: The objective of these surveys was to identify and conclude the functional requirements, the human–robot interaction mechanisms, the design of the robotic assistant and user acceptance aspects.

## care_type
Answer: Medication adherence assistance
Source: This paper presents a novel and complete pipeline for assistance provision in monitoring and serving of medication, using a mobile manipulator embedded with action, perception and cognition skills.

## robot_type
Answer: Mobile manipulator with a 2 DoF head, elevation mechanism, and a three-fingered robotic hand
Source: The RAMCIP robot is equipped with a three-fingered robotic hand with nine degrees-of-freedom, suitable to perform grasping of different objects with various grasping strategies.

## robot_name
Answer: RAMCIP robot
Source: The RAMCIP robot was researched and developed under the scope of the European Project "Robotic Assistant for MCI Patients at Home".

## design_goal
Answer: To provide solutions in perception, cognition, and action problems for assistive robots in real home environments
Source: The ultimate goal of this paper is to provide solutions in a series of perception, cognition and action problems that will enable, in the near future, assistive robots' deployment in real home environments.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Medication fetching, monitoring, and communication
Source: The robot should be able to locate, detect and fetch the pill box; monitor and assess the progress of the medication adherence activity; establish communication with external person in cases were medication process has not been completed successfully.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Vision-based object detection, grasping strategies with environmental contact, and POMDP decision-making
Source: The development of an integrated vision system able to perform object and human detection and tracking suitable for monitoring of medication activities; the integration of novel object grasping strategies with environmental contact; the development of a POMDP model that can handle the uncertainty of the perception input and promptly decide on the next best robot action.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Localization errors, action recognition errors, and communication errors
Source: The erroneous executions that occurred relied firstly on the localization error where—in four instances—the robot parked with the wrong orientation. Human activity recognition is also a very challenging task in uncontrolled environments and, as expected, affected the outcome of the evaluation. Communication issues also led to failures.
