## key_findings
Answer: Developed facial expression and gesture designs for six emotions in social robots interacting with elderly individuals; guidelines for designing human-friendly robot facial expressions and gestures
Source: As a result of the study, we developed facial expression and gesture designs for six emotions (Loving, Joyful, Upbeat, Hopeful, Concerned, Grateful) in social robots interacting with elderly individuals. The results provide guidelines for designing human-friendly robot facial expressions and gestures, thus enabling social robots to form deep emotional bonds with users.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include a single facial expression and gesture for each emotion, not accounting for variations in emotional intensity; future research should categorize emotional intensity and refine emotional expression
Source: Nevertheless, this study is constrained by the fact that it presents a single facial expression and gesture for each emotion, which does not account for the potential variations in emotional intensity. Future research should develop a series of facial expressions and gestures that will categorize emotional intensity and further refine the emotional expression of social robots.
