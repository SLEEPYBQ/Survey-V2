## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease, caregivers, and university students (evaluators)
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study. They were all clinically diagnosed as AD. We recruited five university students who major in gerontology as evaluators.

## sample_size
Answer: 3 elderly participants, 5 university student evaluators
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study. We recruited five university students who major in gerontology as evaluators.

## country
Answer: Japan
Source: The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months in a group home for seniors with dementia in Osaka, Japan.

## age
Answer: 85 to 96 years old
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study.

## gender
Answer: All female
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study.

## demographic_background
Answer: Seniors with Alzheimer's disease living in a group home; university students majoring in gerontology
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study. They were all clinically diagnosed as AD. We recruited five university students who major in gerontology as evaluators.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: All participants had Alzheimer's disease; Ms. A and Ms. B had moderate dementia (MMSE scores 12-17), Ms. C had severe dementia (MMSE score 0)
Source: Ms. A and Ms. B had moderate dementia (MMSE scores 12-17), Ms. C had severe dementia (MMSE score 0).

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly participants needed communication support; caregivers needed tools to improve communication with residents
Source: It is important for caregivers to motivate seniors with AD to communicate to cope with BPSD and to suppress progress of dementia.

## application_context
Answer: Group home for seniors with dementia
Source: We discussed the possibility of introducing a teleoperated robot into an elderly care house for long-term interaction.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Long-term deployment (3 months), sessions lasted 15 minutes each, conducted 1-2 times per week
Source: The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months... The duration of the conversations was limited to 15 min each.

## methodology
Answer: Mixed methods - quantitative (questionnaires, video analysis) and qualitative (observations)
Source: After both conditions were conducted, the speaker and the observer answered questionnaires. From the video recordings, we counted the number of times that the participants used body gestures and made physical contact.

## care_type
Answer: Communication support for seniors with Alzheimer's disease
Source: We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors.

## robot_type
Answer: Teleoperated robot with soft vinyl covering, child-like appearance
Source: Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice.

## robot_name
Answer: Telenoid R3b
Source: In the Telenoid condition, the speakers controlled a Telenoid R3b.

## design_goal
Answer: To provide communication support and motivate seniors to communicate
Source: We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Transmits operator's physical movements and voice, allows physical interaction (hugging, touching)
Source: Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice. Telenoid users can physically interact (hug and touch) with the robot while communicating with an operator.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Physical interaction (hugging, touching), child-like appearance which seniors found comforting
Source: The small and soft body of Telenoid allows people to hold it while having conversation through it, allowing one to have communication with multiple modalities including visual and tactile sensations besides dialogue.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited non-verbal communication capabilities for severe AD patients
Source: One of the speaker's comments on the questionnaire said, "Non-verbal information, like holding hands and eye contact, is important, but communicating this through Telenoid was difficult."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Moderate AD patients showed positive reactions to Telenoid; child-like appearance facilitated interaction
Source: The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid. Both became less nervous while communicating with Telenoid from the time they were first introduced to it.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe AD patients had difficulty with verbal communication through Telenoid
Source: Ms. C was transferred to a special nursing home for the elderly at the end of the experiment and could conduct the test after the experiment... Verbal communication was difficult with her.

## engagement
Answer: High engagement with Telenoid, especially for moderate AD patients
Source: The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid.

## acceptance
Answer: Positive acceptance of Telenoid by moderate AD patients
Source: The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid.

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development observed in Telenoid condition
Source: Both became less nervous while communicating with Telenoid from the time they were first introduced to it.

## key_findings
Answer: Telenoid improved communication for moderate AD patients; physical interaction increased; child-like appearance was beneficial
Source: The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid. Both became less nervous while communicating with Telenoid from the time they were first introduced to it. Moreover, they started to use more body gestures in the face-to-face condition and more physical interactions in the Telenoid-mediated condition.

## additional_info
Answer: Study limitations include small sample size and lack of comparison with other robots
Source: The experiment did not prove the effect of Telenoid itself, since the speakers had conversations both with Telenoid and face-to-face... Another limitation of the current study lies in that its results do not show the effect of using Telenoid in comparison with other robots.

## testing_context
Answer: Group home public spaces (dining room or TV room)
Source: All conversations were exchanged in a public space, either in the dining room or the TV room.
