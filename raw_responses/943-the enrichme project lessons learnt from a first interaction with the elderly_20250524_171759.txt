## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment, caregivers, and technical solution providers
Source: The main purpose of the ENRICHME European project is to develop a socially assistive robot that can help the elderly, adapt to their needs, and has a natural behavior.

## sample_size
Answer: 2 elderly participants for direct interaction; additional residents participated in a demo
Source: This being the first interaction between the possible final users and the robot, only two elderly individuals were selected to interact with the robot and to test the modules that were created so far.

## country
Answer: United Kingdom
Source: The current work summarizes some of the lessons learnt from a first interaction with the elderly from LACE Housing Ltd, an elderly care facility in the UK.

## age
Answer: Participant P1 is 73 years old; Participant P2 is 83 years old
Source: Participant P1 is a 73 years old introverted male who suffers from Parkinson's disease and has cerebellar ataxia. Participant P2 is a 83 years old extroverted female and has arthritis.

## gender
Answer: Participant P1 is male; Participant P2 is female
Source: Participant P1 is a 73 years old introverted male; Participant P2 is a 83 years old extroverted female.

## demographic_background
Answer: Participants are residents of a care facility; P1 has Parkinson's disease and cerebellar ataxia; P2 has arthritis
Source: Participant P1 is a 73 years old introverted male who suffers from Parkinson's disease and has cerebellar ataxia. Participant P2 is a 83 years old extroverted female and has arthritis.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: P1 has Parkinson's disease and cerebellar ataxia; P2 has arthritis; mild cognitive impairment is implied for both
Source: Participant P1 is a 73 years old introverted male who suffers from Parkinson's disease and has cerebellar ataxia. Participant P2 is a 83 years old extroverted female and has arthritis.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Participants found the robot useful but had complaints about font size and puzzle difficulty; they preferred larger buttons and simpler games
Source: Based on the questionnaire regarding their likes and dislikes, the two participants enjoyed playing the games (approval of 4.2/5) except the puzzle game (approval of 1/5). They liked the layout, and the size of the buttons was large enough for them. One complaint was that the font size of 4 mm used for some instructions was too small.

## application_context
Answer: The robot is designed for long-term interaction in the homes of elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment
Source: The project aims at developing a robotic system that can help elderly to remain independent longer and enhance their everyday life.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: First encounter with the robot; interaction duration was 37 minutes for P1 and 29 minutes for P2
Source: The total recording times for P1 and P2 are 37 and 29 min, respectively.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, questionnaires, and sensor data analysis
Source: After the interaction, each participant was given two questionnaires: a personality questionnaire, with 46 questions, based on the Big Five personality factors, and a custom made questionnaire, with 58 questions, developed for finding out what the participants liked or disliked about the graphical interface and the overall robot behavior.

## care_type
Answer: Socially assistive care for elderly with mild cognitive impairment
Source: The main purpose of the ENRICHME European project is to develop a socially assistive robot that can help the elderly, adapt to their needs, and has a natural behavior.

## robot_type
Answer: Human-like robot with a touchscreen and speech capabilities
Source: The robot can also use speech recognition and synthesis to communicate. The torso of the robot features a touchscreen to facilitate user interaction.

## robot_name
Answer: Kompaï
Source: ENRICHME project uses the Kompa¨ı robot designed by Robosoft.

## design_goal
Answer: To develop a socially assistive robot that can help the elderly, adapt to their needs, and has a natural behavior
Source: The main purpose of the ENRICHME European project is to develop a socially assistive robot that can help the elderly, adapt to their needs, and has a natural behavior.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Cognitive games, physical exercises, and healthy eating tips
Source: The possible activities are: playing a cognitive game, doing some physical exercises, or learning some healthy eating tips.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Touchscreen interface, speech recognition, and adaptive behavior
Source: The robot can also use speech recognition and synthesis to communicate. The torso of the robot features a touchscreen to facilitate user interaction.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Small font size and difficult puzzle game
Source: One complaint was that the font size of 4 mm used for some instructions was too small. Another complaint was regarding the puzzle game. The participants and other residents found that 30 pieces of puzzle for medium level were too many.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Extroverted personality and familiarity with technology
Source: Participant P2 is a 83 years old extroverted female and has arthritis.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Introverted personality and physical impairments
Source: Participant P1 is a 73 years old introverted male who suffers from Parkinson's disease and has cerebellar ataxia.

## engagement
Answer: Participants enjoyed playing the games (approval of 4.2/5) except the puzzle game (approval of 1/5)
Source: Based on the questionnaire regarding their likes and dislikes, the two participants enjoyed playing the games (approval of 4.2/5) except the puzzle game (approval of 1/5).

## acceptance
Answer: Participants found the robot's approach behavior natural (approval of 5/5) and friendly (approval of 4.5/5)
Source: Based on the questionnaire regarding their thoughts on the overall behavior of the robot, both participants found the robot's approach behavior natural (approval of 5/5), in its approach it was neither dominant nor submissive (approval of 3/5), and appeared to be friendly (approval of 4.5/5).

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Facial temperature variations and facial expressions can be observed and used to adapt robot behavior; participants found the robot useful but had specific complaints
Source: From the results of this work, we can posit that the facial temperature variations and facial expressions variations can be observed. The robot could adapt its behavior based on these variations to provide a more natural interaction with the elderly.

## additional_info
Answer: The study had limitations such as small sample size and short interaction duration; future tests will involve more participants and longer periods
Source: More tests will take place in the near future with more participants and for longer periods of time.

## testing_context
Answer: Participants' homes in a care facility
Source: The robot interacted with the participants in their own homes.
