## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Physical aging leads to deterioration in physiological and cognitive functions, such as impaired vision and hearing, reduced motor, reaction, memory, and learning-related abilities.
Source: The physical aging of elderly people often leads to a gradual deterioration in physiological and cognitive functions, such as impaired vision and hearing, reduced motor, reaction, memory and learning-related abilities.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly users prefer expression designs that are warm, friendly, simple, easy to understand, clear, eye-catching, and evoke emotional resonance.
Source: The majority of participants (41) felt that the emoji design needed to be warm and friendly so as to bring a sense of approachability and comfort. The majority of participants (26) expected that the design of expressions for older users should be simple and easy to understand so as not to cause unnecessary confusion.

## application_context
Answer: Elderly home service scenario
Source: an intelligent robot with the ability of "perceive, learn, understand or reason to form new knowledge and respond to new situations" has become a way to alleviate loneliness in the elderly home service scenario.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: PAD emotion model, SAM measure, quantitative surveys, and qualitative interviews
Source: Firstly, based on the PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) emotion model... the SAM measure conveys cartoon picture information... in-depth interviews were conducted with the participants.

## care_type
Answer: N/A

## robot_type
Answer: Intelligent service robot
Source: an optimal design method for the facial expression interface of the elderly intelligent service robot based on the user's emotional experience is proposed.

## robot_name
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## design_goal
Answer: To reduce the cognitive burden of elderly users and enhance interaction performance and emotional satisfaction.
Source: In order to explore the aging-friendly design features of the facial expression interface of the elderly intelligent robot and reduce the cognitive burden of the elderly users... to enhance interaction performance so as to improve the interaction experience of elderly users.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Facial expression interaction interface
Source: The expression interaction interface is the most direct way to interact with intelligent robotic products and devices.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Digital style expressions with geometric combinations, which are simple, intuitive, and reduce cognitive load.
Source: the digital style emoji design solution expresses emotions in a simple combination of geometric shapes, which expression messages are more intuitive than text messages in terms of visual stimulation and are more in line with the physical structure and emotional responses of elderly users.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Anthropomorphic style expressions, which are more complex and have lower recognition rates.
Source: The lowest overall recognition rate was the anthropomorphic style, with 65.27% for the elderly and 81.43% for the young.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Elderly users with higher satisfaction and recognition rates for digital style expressions.
Source: elderly people have the highest recognition rate of digital style, so the expression design of digital style can reduce recognitive load.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Elderly users with lower familiarity with smart products and lower recognition rates for complex styles.
Source: elderly people are less familiar with smart products than younger people, so the recognition rate for three design styles is also lower than younger people.

## engagement
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## acceptance
Answer: Elderly users showed higher acceptance for digital style expressions.
Source: the elderly have the highest recognition rate of digital style, so the expression design of digital style can reduce recognitive load.

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: The PAD emotion model effectively explores the characteristics and rules of expression interaction design for elderly intelligent robots. Digital style expressions are most preferred by elderly users.
Source: According to the experimental results, the PAD emotion model can effectively explore the characteristics and rules of the expression interaction design of intelligent service robots suitable for elderly... elderly people have the highest recognition rate of digital style.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include the study being based on elderly users in China and the scope being limited to questionnaire surveys.
Source: this study is based on elderly users in China... the scope of this study is limited to questionnaire survey.

## testing_context
Answer: Indoor space with a monitor display
Source: In order to reduce external interference, the experiment was carried out in an indoor space... The experimental materials used Adobe PS software to process black face background and unified the size of 600× 400. Moreover, the 8 emoji designs were presented through a monitor.
