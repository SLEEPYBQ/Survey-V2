## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly people living alone, students (participants in experiments)
Source: "the number of elderly people over the age of 65 who live alone has increased year by year" and "Interaction experiments were conducted with students at our university and participants were four males and two females in their 20s."

## sample_size
Answer: 6 participants (4 males and 2 females)
Source: "participants were four males and two females in their 20s."

## country
Answer: Japan

## age
Answer: Participants in their 20s
Source: "participants were four males and two females in their 20s."

## gender
Answer: 4 males, 2 females

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly people need increased frequency of conversation and interaction to prevent social isolation
Source: "it is necessary to provide support to increase the frequency of conversation among isolated elderly people."

## application_context
Answer: Support for elderly people living alone to increase conversation frequency
Source: "it is necessary to provide support to increase the frequency of conversation among isolated elderly people."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use (5-minute experiments)
Source: "experiments for the physical contact interaction was conducted for 5 minutes"

## methodology
Answer: Experimental evaluation with interviews
Source: "the robot system is evaluated through brief interviews and observations."

## care_type
Answer: Social interaction support
Source: "support to increase the frequency of conversation among isolated elderly people."

## robot_type
Answer: Teddy bear-like design
Source: "we developed a physical contact robot interface based on a teddy bear-like design"

## robot_name
Answer: Ryu (Robot B), iPhonoid-C (Robot A)
Source: "we used Robot A (iPhonoid-C: Smart device based robot) and Robot B (Ryu: Teddy bear shaped robot) systems."

## design_goal
Answer: To create a stimulating environment for elderly communication through touch interaction
Source: "The interaction with robot partners could create a good stimulating environment so that the elderly could communicate with their family and others."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Touch interaction (head touching, arm bending, body shaking), verbal communication
Source: "the action of touching the head, bending the arm, and shaking the body is measured by the sensor"

## facilitating_functions
Answer: LED color feedback helps users understand robot's internal state
Source: "it could visually express the internal information of the robot so that it could be a reference for how the user should react to the robot."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Contradictory responses between LED color and utterance caused confusion
Source: "In the case of contradictory responses between LED color and utterance, the test participants commented as follows: 'The reaction was different from what I thought, so I don't know how to interact with it.'"

## engagement
Answer: Physical contact increased engagement opportunities
Source: "it is considered that physical contact will be an opportunity to increase the number of times engagement in human-robot interaction."

## acceptance
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Physical contact interaction can increase engagement opportunities in human-robot interaction, but longer-term experiments are needed
Source: "it is considered that physical contact will be an opportunity to increase the number of times engagement in human-robot interaction. However, the experiments show results of the interaction in a short period of time."

## additional_info
Answer: Study limitations include short interaction period and need for real home environment testing
Source: "the experiments show results of the interaction in a short period of time. Accordingly, it is necessary to perform experiments for longer periods of interaction in a real home environment."

## testing_context
Answer: University setting (lab environment)
Source: "Interaction experiments were conducted with students at our university"
