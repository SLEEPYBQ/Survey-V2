## methodology
Answer: Short-term interaction study with questionnaires (GODSPEED and NARS)
Source: "we conducted a short-term interaction study with the Furhat robot [...] The session started when the participant entered the room with the robot and sat down on a chair in front of the robot table [...] After roughly 10 minutes of conversation, the robot said goodbye and the participant was asked to return to the other room and fill in the GODSPEED and NARS questionnaire."

Despite these scores, all participants were engaged in the interaction with the robot."

## additional_info
Answer: Recruitment was unexpectedly difficult; some older adults declined participation after seeing the robot.
Source: "It might be worth mentioning that recruitment of participants at the senior centre was unexpectedly difficult. Some older adults expressed that they did not want anything to do with a robot, some declined participation after seeing the robot, and some did not want to interact with the robot alone."

## testing_context
Answer: Senior centre in Linköping, Sweden
