## application_context
Answer: Healthcare assistants for older people
Source: Such robots are intended to promote and/or monitor seniors' health status, providing aids in everyday tasks, preventing physical and cognitive decline, through physical, mental, social, and emotional exercises useful for solving psychosocial problems.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use (single session)
Source: Participants watched and listened to each robot's video clip and, immediately after, they were required to complete for the seen video clip the remaining sections of the RAQ digitalized questionnaire.

## methodology
Answer: Quantitative survey using the Robot Acceptance Questionnaire (RAQ)
Source: A digitalized version of the Robots' Acceptance Questionnaire (RAQ) was exploited in order to collect data concerning participants' preferences toward the proposed robots.

## care_type
Answer: Healthcare assistance
Source: Such robots are intended to promote and/or monitor seniors' health status, providing aids in everyday tasks, preventing physical and cognitive decline, through physical, mental, social, and emotional exercises useful for solving psychosocial problems.

## robot_type
Answer: Female robots: Pepper (humanoid), Erica (android), Sophia (android); Male robots: Romeo (humanoid), Geminoid HI-1/Yuri (android), Geminoid DK/Albert (android)
Source: The female robots were: Pepper, renamed "Tina" in order to contextualize its gender as female, (Figure 1a), Erica (Figure 1b) and Sophia (Figure 1c). The male robots were Romeo (Figure 2a), Geminoid HI-1, renamed Yuri, (Figure 2b) and Geminoid DK, renamed Albert (Figure 2c).

## robot_name
Answer: Female robots: Tina (Pepper), Erica, Sophia; Male robots: Romeo, Yuri (Geminoid HI-1), Albert (Geminoid DK)
Source: The female robots were: Pepper, renamed "Tina" in order to contextualize its gender as female, (Figure 1a), Erica (Figure 1b) and Sophia (Figure 1c). The male robots were Romeo (Figure 2a), Geminoid HI-1, renamed Yuri, (Figure 2b) and Geminoid DK, renamed Albert (Figure 2c).

## design_goal
Answer: To investigate elders' preferences towards robots with different degrees of human-likeness, gender, and ethnicity
Source: The present study aims at investigating: a) elders' preferences towards robots with different degrees of human-likeness (humanoid versus android types); b) elders' preferences for robots' gender; and c) elders' preferences for robots' ethnicity.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Speaking function (introducing themselves and offering assistance)
Source: The speech produced was the Italian sentence "Ciao sono Tina/ Erica/ Sophia/ Romeo/ Yuri/ Albert. Se vuoi posso aiutarti nelle tue attività quotidiane" (Hi, my name is Tina/ Erica/ Sophia/ Romeo/ Yuri/ Albert. If you want, I would like to assist in your daily activities).

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Male seniors were more proactive than female ones in their attitude toward robots
Source: Male seniors were more proactive than female ones in their attitude toward robots showing more willingness to interact with them and attributing more positive scores to robots' qualities.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Female seniors showed less willingness to interact with robots
Source: Male participants (mean= 2.557) were more available than female (mean= 3.086 p= .039) to interact with the proposed robots.

## engagement
Answer: Evaluated through Robot Acceptance Questionnaire (RAQ) sections on willingness to interact, pragmatic qualities, hedonic qualities, and attractiveness
Source: Section 2 investigated participants' willingness to interact with the proposed robots, this section consisted in a single item. Section 3, 4, 5 and 6 (each one comprising ten items) assessed respectively: 1) robots' Pragmatic Qualities (PQ), i.e. how useful, effective, practical, clear and controllable the proposed robot is perceived; 2) robots' Hedonic Qualities-Identity (HQI), i.e. how original, creative, presentable, and aesthetically pleasing the proposed robot appears; 3) robots' Hedonic Qualities- Feeling (HQF) concerning both positive and negative emotions aroused by the vision of the robot; 4) robots' Attractiveness (ATT) evaluating how the proposed robot encourage increased use and positive emotions [10, 11].

## acceptance
Answer: Evaluated through Robot Acceptance Questionnaire (RAQ) sections on willingness to interact, pragmatic qualities, hedonic qualities, and attractiveness

## key_findings
Answer: Male seniors were more proactive than female ones in their attitude toward robots; androids were clearly more preferred than humanoid robots; seniors' preferences were for female android robots with Asian traits and male android with Caucasian traits
Source: Through this investigation it was found that male seniors were more proactive than female ones in their attitude toward robots showing more willingness to interact with them and attributing more positive scores to robots' qualities. It was also observed that androids were clearly more preferred than humanoid robots no matter their gender. Finally, seniors' preferences were for female android robots with Asian traits and male android with Caucasian traits suggesting that both gender and ethnical features are intermingled in defining robot's appearance that generate seniors' acceptance.
