Source: Groups 1 and 4... mean age = 14.09, SD = ± .29, and 20 males and 25 females in Group 4, mean age = 14.67, SD = ± 48... Groups 2 and 5... mean age = 25.60, SD = ± 2.72... Groups 3 and 6... mean age = 73.04, SD = ± 7.03... mean age = 72.44, SD = ± 6.40

## gender
Answer: Adolescents (20 males and 25 females in Group 1, 20 males and 25 females in Group 4), young adults (12 males and 18 females in Group 2, 15 males and 15 females in Group 5), seniors (22 males and 23 females in Group 3, 19 males and 26 females in Group 6)
Source: 20 males and 25 females in Group 1... 12 males and 18 females in Group 2... 22 males and 23 females in Group 3... 15 males and 15 females in Group 5... 19 males and 26 females in Group 6

## demographic_background
Answer: Participants' experience with technological devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops), frequency of use, and easiness of use were reported
Source: Table 1: Adolescents, young and older adults' experience with technological devices... Table 2: Participants' self-declared frequency of use of smartphones, tables, and laptops... Table 3: Participants' self-declared easiness of use of smartphones, tables, and laptops

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Participants expressed willingness to interact with robots and their preferences for robots' usefulness, pleasantness, appeal, and engagement
Source: Participants were requested to express their willingness to interact and their perception of robots' usefulness, pleasantness, appeal, and engagement

## application_context
Answer: Socially assistive robots (SARs) for supporting older adults in daily activities, promoting healthier behaviors, and extending independent living
Source: Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) should act as companions, navigation and communication tools, and coaches by promoting elders' wellbeing simultaneously minimising risks deriving from physical and cognitive shortcomings due to ageing

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Digitalized version of the Robots' Acceptance Questionnaire (RAQ) administered after watching video clips of robots
Source: Participants' preferences toward the proposed robots were assessed by administering a digitalized version of the Robots' Acceptance Questionnaire (RAQ)

## care_type
Answer: Socially assistive care for elderly
Source: Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) should act as companions, navigation and communication tools, and coaches by promoting elders' wellbeing

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid (Pepper, Romeo) and android (Erica, Sophia, Yuri, Albert) robots
Source: The humanoid (a) Pepper and the two android robots Erica (b) and Sophia (c)... The humanoid (a) Romeo and the two android robots Yuri (b) and Albert (c)

## robot_name
Answer: Pepper (Tina), Erica, Sophia, Romeo, Yuri, Albert
Source: Each robot, depending on the gender attributed to it, was endowed with an Italian female or male synthetic voice... "Ciao sono Tina/ Erica/ Sophia/ Romeo/ Yuri/ Albert"

## design_goal
Answer: To investigate effects of participants' gender and age, robots' gender and appearance on robots' acceptance dimensions
Source: This paper investigates effects of participants' gender and age (adolescents, young adults, and seniors), robots' gender (male and female robots) and appearance (humanoid vs android) on robots' acceptance dimensions

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Robots were introduced as potential assistants in daily activities
Source: "If you allow, I can assist you in your daily activities"

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Humanoid robots were preferred by adolescents for being more engaging and pleasant; android robots were preferred by seniors
Source: Adolescents' preferences toward humanoid robots... seniors' preferences toward android robots

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Seniors showed less willingness to interact with robots compared to younger groups
Source: Seniors (mean = 3.052) were significantly less willing than adolescents (mean =2.132, p <<.01) and young adults (mean = 1.801, p <<.01) to interact with the proposed female robots

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Younger age and higher familiarity with technology were associated with better robot acceptance
Source: Adolescents and young adults were more willing than seniors to interact with robots... adolescents and young adults declared a high experience with technological devices

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Older age and lower familiarity with technology were associated with reduced robot acceptance
Source: Seniors were significantly less willing to interact... 48.89% of older adults reported no experience with technological devices

## engagement
Answer: Adolescents and young adults showed higher engagement scores than seniors
Source: Adolescents (mean = 25.830, p = .003) attributed to female robots higher HQI scores than seniors (mean = 29.289)

## acceptance
Answer: Adolescents and young adults showed higher acceptance scores than seniors
Source: Adolescents (mean = 24.817) attributed to robots significantly higher attractiveness scores than seniors (mean = 26.943, p = .002)

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Robots' acceptance appeared to be a nonlinear combination of age, gender, and appearance factors
Source: Robots' acceptance appeared to be a nonlinear combination of all these factors

## additional_info
Answer: The study had limitations in identifying all factors affecting robot acceptance
Source: These factors can originate from cultural and social conducts, cognitive efforts and personal needs, education levels, and environmental constraints... More data need to be collected to establish secure guidelines

## testing_context
Answer: Participants watched video clips of robots and completed digital questionnaires
Source: Subsequently participants were randomly assigned either to the female or male set of robots' video clips and after randomly watching each robot in the set, asked to fill the digitalized questionnaire
