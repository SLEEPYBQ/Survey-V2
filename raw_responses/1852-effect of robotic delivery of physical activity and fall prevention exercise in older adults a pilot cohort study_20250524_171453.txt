## country
Answer: United States (Michigan)
Source: Participants were recruited via convenience sampling from the Auburn Hills Community Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan.

## age
Answer: Mean age 75 years (range: 66-83 years)
Source: The mean age of the participants was 75 years (range: 66-83 years; four females and one male).

## gender
Answer: 4 females, 1 male
Source: The mean age of the participants was 75 years (range: 66-83 years; four females and one male).

## demographic_background
Answer: 4 White/Caucasian, 1 African American/Black; 1 single, 4 married; all retired; income range $10,001-$100,000; 3 with bachelor's degree, 2 with high school education; all had smartphones, 3 used tablets/computers, 1 used smartwatch
Source: Four participants reported being White or Caucasian and one as African American or Black. One participant was single, while the other four were married. All participants were retired with a variety of annual household incomes (range = US$10,001 to US$100,000). Three participants had a bachelor's degree, while two had a high school level education. All five participants reported having a smartphone, while three of the five participants also reported using a tablet and a computer. One person reported using a smartwatch.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: No cognitive impairment (Mini-Cog >3 or TMT B <273 sec); physical impairments not specified beyond fall risk
Source: Participants had no self-reported diagnosis of dementia or other cognitive impairment, have no physical or medical impairment that would impact participating in standing exercises or a 15-minute walking program, pass physical and cognitive pre-screening assessments.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for fall prevention exercise; expectations included improved balance confidence and physical performance
Source: The purpose of this study was to examine feasibility and initial outcomes of a robot-delivered fall prevention exercise program for community-dwelling older adults.

## application_context
Answer: Home-based exercise for community-dwelling older adults
Source: Using a robot-led exercise program is an accessible and feasible way to deliver exercise to community-dwelling older adults in the home.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 4-week program with 3 sessions/week; each session included 30 minutes of OEP and 15 minutes of walking
Source: Five participants aged 65 years and older were recruited to receive robot-delivered modified OEP and walking program three times per week for four weeks.

## methodology
Answer: Pilot cohort study with pre-post intervention measures
Source: After securing Oakland University Institutional Review Board (#FY2022-206) approval, a pilot cohort study of five participants aged 65 years and older was initiated.

## care_type
Answer: Fall prevention exercise
Source: The purpose of this study was to examine feasibility and initial outcomes of a robot-delivered fall prevention exercise program for community-dwelling older adults.

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid social robots (NAO and Pepper)
Source: A NAO social robot... Then, a second Pepper robot delivered a 15-minute walking program.

## robot_name
Answer: NAO and Pepper
Source: A NAO social robot... Then, a second Pepper robot delivered a 15-minute walking program.

## design_goal
Answer: To deliver evidence-based fall prevention exercises similar to physical therapist interactions
Source: Emphasis was placed on the demonstration and verbal instructions being similar to that of a physical therapist interaction.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Delivering modified Otago Exercise Program and walking program
Source: The exercise interventions were delivered three times a week for four weeks... a NAO social robot was tasked with delivering a 15-minute modified level B OEP... Then, a second Pepper robot delivered a 15-minute walking program.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Verbal instructions, exercise demonstration, social conversation; improved access to exercise
Source: Participants generally agreed that exercising with a robot improved access to exercise and that they would be willing to use a robot in their home.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited movement range, occasional falls, overheating joints; participants preferred human interaction
Source: Participants disagreed that exercising with a robot is preferred to exercising with another person after completing the program.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Positive attitudes toward technology, perceived enjoyment; improved anxiety and social presence over time
Source: Constructs that started positive (>4) and remained positive were Attitudes Toward Technology and Perceived Enjoyment. Anxiety improved from 3.80 to 4.68, while Social Presence of the robot improved from 2.80 to 3.56.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Initial low trust in robot, preference for human interaction
Source: The construct of Trust was somewhat negative among participants upon commencing the program and did not substantially change over time.

## engagement
Answer: Mixed results; some positive engagement but participants gravitated toward human interaction
Source: Participants tended to gravitate toward interacting with the key personnel instead of the robot.

## acceptance
Answer: Initially neutral/mixed; improved effectiveness perception vs exercising alone but not vs groups/videos
Source: Participants' responses suggested that the older adults believed exercising with a robot would be more effective and motivating than exercising alone with minimal to no change in this perception before and after participating in the program.

## trust
Answer: Somewhat negative initially and did not substantially change
Source: The construct of Trust was somewhat negative among participants upon commencing the program and did not substantially change over time.

## key_findings
Answer: Robot-delivered exercise is feasible for community-dwelling older adults; showed positive trends in health outcomes; some technical constraints remain
Source: Using a robot-led exercise program is an accessible and feasible way to deliver exercise to community-dwelling older adults in the home, but some technical constraints remain.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, human interaction bias, and robot movement limitations
Source: The small sample size was referred from one community center with varying comorbidities; therefore, the findings cannot be generalized broadly to all older adults.

## testing_context
Answer: Engineering Center at Oakland University with safety personnel present
Source: The exercise interventions were delivered three times a week for four weeks and took place in August 2022 in the Engineering Center at Oakland University (OU) in Rochester, Michigan.
