## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for improved communication, interaction skills, and activity participation; desire for social interaction and engagement; participants looked forward to interacting with Paro and were more willing to join group activities
Source: "By interacting with a robot pet, such as Paro, the communication, interaction skills, and activity participation of the older adults can be improved." "the participants looked forward to interact with Paro and often asked the nursing staff about the time to meet with Paro, and they were more willingly to come out their own room to join the activity with Paro."

## application_context
Answer: Routine activity program in long-term residential care facilities for older adults
Source: "The robot-assisted therapy can be provided as a routine activity program and has the potential to improve social health of older adults in residential care facilities."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Four-week intervention; 30-minute sessions, twice a week; group setting; pretest and posttest assessments
Source: "received a group robot-assisted therapy using a seal-like robot pet for 30 minutes twice a week for 4 weeks." "All participants received assessments... at baseline and at week 4."

## methodology
Answer: One-group pretest and posttest design; quantitative assessments using standardized scales
Source: "This pilot study used a one-group pretest and posttest design." "All participants received assessments... using the Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills (ACIS-C) and activity participation using the Activity Participation Scale..."

## care_type
Answer: Social and mental health care (focus on communication, interaction, and activity participation)
Source: "Animal-assisted therapy is gaining popularity as part of therapeutic activities for older adults in many long-term care facilities." "to improve mental and social health for older adults"

## robot_type
Answer: Seal-like robotic pet
Source: "using a seal-like robot pet" "Another robotic pet is Paro, which was developed... and is a therapeutic robot seal."

## robot_name
Answer: Paro
Source: "Paro, a seal-like robotic pet"

## design_goal
Answer: To serve as a substitute artificial companion for animal-assisted therapy, evoke feelings of warmth, and improve psychological well-being and social interaction among older adults
Source: "The seal-type robot, Paro, was designed to be soft and evoke feeling of warmth." "Robot therapy or robot-assisted therapy uses robots as a substitute for animals through human–animal interactions to improve psychological well-being..."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Reacts to sounds and touch with body movements, baby seal calls, eyes open and close, understands its name, memorizes its name, responds to being called, equipped with tactile, visual, auditory, and posture sensors
Source: "Paro can react to sounds and touching with body movements, baby seal calls, eyes close and open, and the Paro used in the study especially can understand Japanese and can memorize her own name. Paro reacts with body movements vividly with her name being called." "Paro was trimmed in artificial fur... equipped with the four primary senses: sight (light sensor), hearing... balance, and... tactile sense."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Soft and warm appearance, animal-like behavior, ability to respond to touch and sound, ability to recognize its name, evokes positive feelings, encourages interaction, unfamiliar animal form (seal) reduces unrealistic expectations
Source: "The seal-type robot, Paro, was designed to be soft and evoke feeling of warmth." "Paro's artificial intelligence allows genuine animal-like behavior using tactile, visual, auditory, and posture sensors..." "The participants valued seal robot higher because they did not have much knowledge about seals, and therefore unable to compare the seal robot and accept the unfamiliar animals better..."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited time for individual interaction due to only one Paro in group setting; high cost of Paro
Source: "One of the limitations in our study was the use of group setting with only one Paro during the activity, so the time for each participant interacting with Paro was limited due to the expensive cost of purchasing Paro."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Ability to speak Japanese facilitated interaction for some participants; willingness to participate in group activities; curiosity and openness to new experiences
Source: "Five participants in our study could speak Japanese, so they often spoke Japanese when they interacted with Paro. Other participants who also understood Japanese sometimes translated..." "the participants looked forward to interact with Paro and often asked the nursing staff about the time to meet with Paro, and they were more willingly to come out their own room to join the activity with Paro."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## engagement
Answer: High engagement; participants looked forward to interacting with Paro, asked about meeting times, and were more willing to join group activities
Source: "the participants looked forward to interact with Paro and often asked the nursing staff about the time to meet with Paro, and they were more willingly to come out their own room to join the activity with Paro."

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance; Paro was well accepted by participants, who greeted it with smiles and called its name
Source: "In our study, Paro was well accepted by the participants... When the Paro was brought in for the activity, the participants greeted her with smiling and calling out her name."

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Robot-assisted therapy using Paro significantly improved communication, interaction skills, and activity participation among institutionalized older adults; Paro was well accepted and encouraged social engagement
Source: "Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that participants' communication and interaction skills (z = −2.94, P = 0.003) and activity participation (z = −2.66, P = 0.008) were significantly improved after receiving 4-week robot-assisted therapy." "By interacting with a robot pet, such as Paro, the communication, interaction skills, and activity participation of the older adults can be improved."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, one-group pretest-posttest design, possible Hawthorne effect, limited individual interaction time due to only one Paro, and limited generalizability
Source: "This study used a small convenience sample with a one-group pretest and posttest design. There were extraneous variables, such as the impact of contact by research assistants and staff. There is also the possibility of the Hawthorne effect occurring due to the fact that participants had awareness of participation in the study... use of group setting with only one Paro during the activity, so the time for each participant interacting with Paro was limited due to the expensive cost of purchasing Paro."

## testing_context
Answer: Activity room in a residential care facility (nursing home) in Taiwan; group setting
Source: "The study was conducted in a residential care facility in Taiwan." "The participants interacted with the Paro in a group setting in an activity room of the facility in the afternoon."
