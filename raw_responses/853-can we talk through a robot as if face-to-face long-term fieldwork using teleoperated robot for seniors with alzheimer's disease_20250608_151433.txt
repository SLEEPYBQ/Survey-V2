## technology_literacy
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Cognitive: Alzheimer's disease (MMSE scores 0-17); Physical: Not explicitly described beyond general age-related decline
Source: "They were all clinically diagnosed as AD." "Her MMSE score was 0, indicating severe dementia." "Ms. A had moderate dementia." "Ms. B had moderate dementia."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs: Communication support, social interaction; Expectations: Positive reactions to robot interaction
Source: "We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors." "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## application_context
Answer: Long-term communication support in elderly care facilities
Source: "We discuss the possibilities of using Telenoid as a tool to provide opportunities for seniors to communicate over the long term."

## testing_context
Answer: Group home for seniors with dementia (dining room or TV room)
Source: "All conversations were exchanged in a public space, either in the dining room or the TV room."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 10 trials per participant over 3 months, 15-minute sessions per condition
Source: "We conducted 10 trials (interactions) for each participant." "The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months." "The duration of the conversations was limited to 15 min each."

## methodology
Answer: Mixed methods: Quantitative (questionnaires, video analysis) and qualitative (observations)
Source: "The speaker and the observer answered questionnaires." "From the video recordings, we counted the number of times that the participants used body gestures and made physical contact."

## robot_type
Answer: Teleoperated robot with soft vinyl covering, child-like appearance
Source: "Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice." "Telenoid's child-like appearance might attract residents."

## robot_name
Answer: Telenoid R3b
Source: "Telenoid R3b (Figure 1)"

## design_goal
Answer: To provide communication support and motivate seniors to communicate
Source: "We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors." "Telenoid's child-like appearance might attract residents and motivates them to communicate."

## robot_general_function
Answer: Transmits operator's movements and voice, allows physical interaction (hugging, touching)
Source: "Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice." "Telenoid users can physically interact (hug and touch) with the robot."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Physical interaction (hugging, touching), child-like appearance, voice transmission
Source: "They treated Telenoid as a child, which is huggable and easier to touch." "Telenoid's child-like appearance might attract residents." "Transmits operator's voice."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited non-verbal communication capability
Source: "Non-verbal information, like holding hands and eye contact, is important, but communicating this through Telenoid was difficult."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Moderate dementia showed better response than severe dementia
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid." "Ms. C has severe AD, and it was difficult to verbally communicate with her."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe dementia showed limited response
Source: "Ms. C has severe AD, and it was difficult to verbally communicate with her."

## engagement
Answer: Positive engagement observed in moderate dementia cases
Source: "Both became less nervous while communicating with Telenoid from the time they were first introduced to it."

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance in moderate dementia cases
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## robot_function_effectiveness
Answer: Effective for moderate dementia, less effective for severe dementia
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid." "Ms. C has severe AD, and it was difficult to verbally communicate with her."

## user_satisfaction
Answer: Higher satisfaction in Telenoid condition for moderate dementia
Source: "The Q4 scores (participant's impression) from both Ms. A and Ms. B supported the Telenoid condition."

## user_curiosity
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## user_trust_reliance
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## user_understanding
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## learning_curve_productivity
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## system_controllability_interaction
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Telenoid improved communication for moderate dementia, enabled physical interaction, maintained interest over time
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid." "All three participants tended to have more physical contact in the Telenoid condition." "The Telenoid condition had fewer items to improve in the latter five trials; however, no item worsened."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, no comparison with other robots, potential novelty effects
Source: "The experiment did not prove the effect of Telenoid itself." "Another limitation of the current study lies in that its results do not show the effect of using Telenoid in comparison with other robots."
