## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Needs: Improved independence, increased security, support in emergencies. Expectations: Positive impact on daily life, ease of use, trust in robot's ability.  
Source: "The proposed telepresence service is a potential solution to improve both the quality of elders' life and the services provided to them as underlined by Moyle et al. [16]. Indeed, it can support their communication possibilities, promote social inclusion and increase the real, and perceived security."  

## application_context  
Answer: Supporting frail elderly in their homes to live independently and improve social relationships.  
Source: "In this context, a robotic telepresence service could support the frail persons in their homes, empowering their social relationships."  

## testing_context  
Answer: Private homes  
Source: "The proposed protocol is divided into three main phases as depicted in Figure 1. In the first part of the experimental protocol, the engineers trained the social workers to the use of the Double robot and to install it in a private home."  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: Field test lasted 169 days, with 105 telepresence services delivered, averaging 29 mins per service.  
Source: "At the end of the field trials, which lasted 169 days in total, a total of 105 telepresence services were delivered. The average duration of a single service was equal to 29 mins for a total of 2871 mins of usage."  

## methodology  
Answer: Multidimensional evaluation using questionnaires (acceptance, usability, expectation domains) before (T0) and after (TF) field tests.  
Source: "A total of 169 days of field-test trial was evaluated before (TO) and after (TF) the tests with a multidimensional framework, including acceptance, usability, and expectation domains."  

## robot_type  
Answer: Telepresence robot  
Source: "In this work, 10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot (i.e. Double Robot)."  

## robot_name  
Answer: Double Robot  
Source: "In this work, 10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot (i.e. Double Robot)."  

## design_goal  
Answer: To evaluate how human factors influence the potential and real experience of telepresence services.  
Source: "This paper aims to present and discuss how human factors could influence the potential and the real experience of the telepresence services."  

## robot_general_function  
Answer: Remote telepresence service for social interaction and monitoring.  
Source: "The proposed telepresence service allowed the social workers to remote visit the frail seniors at their home, increasing the total number of visits performed in a week."  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Improved independence, increased security, support in emergencies, ease of use, trust in robot's ability.  
Source: "The proposed telepresence service is a potential solution to improve both the quality of elders' life and the services provided to them as underlined by Moyle et al. [16]. Indeed, it can support their communication possibilities, promote social inclusion and increase the real, and perceived security."  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Privacy concerns, fear of the robot, difficulty in communication.  
Source: "Subjects who expected the robot negatively affects their privacy (expectation item 1), their independence (expectation item 6), and their safety (PES) felt also more embarrassed (ANX-Q4) and nervous (ANX-Q5) using the robot."  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Positive a priori attitude, higher trust, more enjoyment, belief in robot's ease of use.  
Source: "A positive a priori attitude is related to more trust towards the robot, more enjoyment in using it, and with the idea that the robot is easy to use."  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Negative bias, fear of the robot, anxiety, tension during interaction.  
Source: "Negative bias towards the robot (i.e. to be afraid of the robot) could increase the subjects' anxiety and the tension during the interaction."  

## engagement  
Answer: Positive trend in enjoyment (ENJ-Q6) after use.  
Source: "After using the robot, people declare to enjoy more than they expected [7]."  

## acceptance  
Answer: Average score of 70.83 at TF for ad-hoc questionnaire (usability and acceptance domains).  
Source: "The mean overall score for the ad-hoc questionnaires (12 items) was 61.17 (SD=12.30) at T0 and 70.83 (SD=9.79) at TF."  

## robot_function_effectiveness  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## user_satisfaction  
Answer: Positive trend in perceived ease of use (PEU-Q11) and trust (TRUST-Q7) after use.  
Source: "After using the robot, subjects generally feel more comfortable, confident, and less scared about it."  

## user_curiosity  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## user_trust_reliance  
Answer: Higher trust (TRUST-Q7) after use.  
Source: "After using the robot, subjects generally feel more comfortable, confident, and less scared about it."

## system_controllability_interaction  
Answer: Positive trend in perceived ease of use (PEU-Q11) after use.  
Source: "After using the robot, subjects generally feel more comfortable, confident, and less scared about it."  

## key_findings  
Answer: Expectation and prejudice play a key role in determining perceived and real usability/acceptance. Real experience improves comfort, confidence, and reduces fear.  
Source: "Expectation and prejudice seem to play a key role, not only in determining the perceived usability/acceptance of a robot but also concerning the real usability and acceptance after the interaction with the robot."  

## additional_info  
Answer: Limitations include small sample size and lack of demographic influence on results.  
Source: "Based on our small sample, it seems that there is no relationship between gender, age, educational level, and family composition in any measurements."
