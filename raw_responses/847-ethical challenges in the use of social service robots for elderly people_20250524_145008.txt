================================================================================

Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided research paper:

## Involved Stakeholder
Elderly people, caregivers, technical solution providers, and researchers.

Source: "Most members of staff and patients see a real robot for the first time."

## Sample Size
N/A

Source: The paper does not provide specific sample size information.

## Country
Austria

Source: "Henry is part of the European science project STRANDS. The robot patrols corridors, offers information on a touchscreen, can be called to the reception to guide visitors to offices and accompanies physiotherapy walking groups, playing music and stimulating participants suffering from dementia by means of sounds and a picture gallery."

## Age
N/A

Source: The paper does not provide specific age-related information.

## Gender
N/A

Source: The paper does not provide specific gender-related information.

## Demographic Background
N/A

Source: The paper does not provide specific demographic background information.

## Cognitive And Physical Impairment
Participants suffering from dementia.

Source: "stimulating participants suffering from dementia by means of sounds and a picture gallery."

## Needs And Expectations
Elderly people expect robots to engage in natural conversation and understand human language. Caregivers hope robots will support senior adults.

Source: "We observed that Henry, when he was first deployed at the care site was often expected to be able to engage in natural conversation and to understand human language."

## Application Context
Care institutions and domestic use for elderly people.

Source: "Socially assistive robots are increasingly discussed as solutions in care and domestic use for the support of senior adults."

## Process Of The Care
N/A

Source: The paper does not provide specific information about the duration and stage of the care process.

## Methodology
Ethical analysis and discussion based on observations and literature review.

Source: "This article aims to provide a brief overview of the major issues identified so far."

## Care Type
Social care and therapy for elderly people, including dementia care.

Source: "The objective is usually to engage patients with dementia in interaction and thus activate and motivate them."

## Robot Type
Anthropomorphic robot with a green covering.

Source: "An autonomous and mobile robot platform with a green covering and anthropomorphic features roams through the corridors of an Austrian care institution."

## Robot Name
Henry

Source: "Meet Henry! An autonomous and mobile robot platform with a green covering and anthropomorphic features roams through the corridors of an Austrian care institution."

## Design Goal
To support senior adults by providing information, guiding visitors, and stimulating participants with dementia.

Source: "The robot patrols corridors, offers information on a touchscreen, can be called to the reception to guide visitors to offices and accompanies physiotherapy walking groups, playing music and stimulating participants suffering from dementia by means of sounds and a picture gallery."

## Robot Concern Function
Patrolling corridors, offering information on a touchscreen, guiding visitors, accompanying physiotherapy walking groups, playing music, and stimulating participants with dementia.

Source: "The robot patrols corridors, offers information on a touchscreen, can be called to the reception to guide visitors to offices and accompanies physiotherapy walking groups, playing music and stimulating participants suffering from dementia by means of sounds and a picture gallery."

## Facilitating Functions
Stimulating participants with dementia, providing information, and guiding visitors.

Source: "stimulating participants suffering from dementia by means of sounds and a picture gallery."

## Inhibitory Functions
Frustration due to inability to engage in natural conversation, potential for deception, and privacy concerns.

Source: "As this was not the case, people were quickly frustrated by failing to communicate with the robot."

## Stakeholder Facilitating Characteristics
N/A

Source: The paper does not provide specific information about stakeholder characteristics facilitating robot use.

## Stakeholder Inhibitory Characteristics
Vulnerability of elderly people, especially those with dementia, and their limited experience with technology.

Source: "The general vulnerability of older persons as participants in robotic research or as users of assistive robots needs to be addressed."

## Engagement
N/A

Source: The paper does not provide specific evaluation of user engagement.

## Acceptance
N/A

Source: The paper does not provide specific evaluation of user acceptance.

## Trust
Concerns about deception and false trust in robots.

Source: "The consequences of anthropomorphization for older persons could be, for example, stress or placing false trust in a machine."

## Key Findings
Ethical challenges in using social service robots for elderly people include privacy, data protection, safety, and the potential for deception, isolation, and loss of autonomy.

Source: "The most important questions are those of privacy and data protection, safety and responsibility as well as involvement of vulnerable persons and deception."

## Additional Info
The paper discusses the need for ethical guidelines and continuous reflection involving end users and caregivers.

Source: "It is highly recommended that ethical guidelines should be analyzed, followed and expanded. This should be a continuous process that also has to involve end users and caregivers."

## Testing Context
Care institution in Austria.
