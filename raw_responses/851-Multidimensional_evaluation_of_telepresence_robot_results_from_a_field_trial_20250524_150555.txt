## age  
Answer: Mean age 75.10 ± 16.48 years old  
Source: "At the end of the recruitment process, a total of ten older adults accepted to be involved in the field trial (aged: 75.10 ± 16.48 years old)."  

## gender  
Answer: 4 male, 6 female

## demographic_background  
Answer: Marital status (1 married, 5 widowed, 4 not married), living situation (2 lived alone, 8 lived with relatives), educational level (5 elementary school, 4 middle school, 1 higher education)  
Source: "One person was married, five persons were widowed, and the remaining were not married. Two persons lived alone, and the others lived with relatives. As concerns the educational level, five persons attended the elementary school, four persons the middle school, and the remaining had a higher educational level."  

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Needs include fostering autonomy, improving caregiver support, and enhancing security. Expectations include concerns about privacy, communication difficulty, and fear of the robot.  
Source: "Subjects who considered that the robot would permit the caregiver to be more present and close to themselves... and also that the robot could be useful in cases of emergency."  

## application_context  
Answer: Telepresence service to support frail elderly in their homes for social interaction and monitoring  
Source: "In this context, a robotic telepresence service could support the frail persons in their homes, empowering their social relationships."  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: Long-term deployment (average 29 mins per session, total 169 days, 105 sessions)  
Source: "At the end of the field trials, which lasted 169 days in total, a total of 105 telepresence services were delivered. The average duration of a single service was equal to 29 mins."  

## methodology  
Answer: Multidimensional evaluation using questionnaires (acceptance, usability, expectation) before (T0) and after (TF) field trials  
Source: "A total of 169 days of field-test trial was evaluated before (TO) and after (TF) the tests with a multidimensional framework, including acceptance, usability, and expectation domains."  

## care_type  
Answer: Social care and remote monitoring  
Source: "The proposed telepresence service is a potential solution to improve both the quality of elders' life and the services provided to them."  

## robot_type  
Answer: Telepresence robot  
Source: "The Double robot is a trade product designed by Double Robotics... It is a self-driving, two-wheeled telepresence robot which mounts an iPad."  

## robot_name  
Answer: Double Robot  
Source: "The Double robot is a trade product designed by Double Robotics."  

## design_goal  
Answer: To support remote social interaction and monitoring for frail elderly  
Source: "The proposed telepresence service is a potential solution to improve both the quality of elders' life and the services provided to them."  

## robot_concern_function  
Answer: Remote telepresence, movement in the environment, charging station docking  
Source: "After authentication (with username and password), a caregiver could use it to move into the environment and interacting with the user in his home."  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Improved autonomy, ease of use, enjoyment, and trust. Positive features include intuitive interface and perceived safety.  
Source: "Subjects who had a higher overall expectation... showed a higher level of trust (TRUST-Q7) in robot ability and presumed that the robot could ameliorate their independence (ITU-Q3)."  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Privacy concerns, fear of the robot, perceived communication difficulty. Negative features include anxiety and perceived invasiveness.  
Source: "Subjects who expected the robot negatively affects their privacy... felt also more embarrassed (ANX-Q4) and nervous (ANX-Q5) using the robot."  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Positive attitude, higher trust, and enjoyment correlate with better acceptance and usability.  
Source: "A positive *a priori* attitude is related to more trust towards the robot, more enjoyment in using it, and with the idea that the robot is easy to use."  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Negative bias (e.g., fear of the robot) increases anxiety and reduces acceptance.  
Source: "Negative bias towards the robot (i.e. to be afraid of the robot) could increase the subjects' anxiety and the tension during the interaction."  

## engagement  
Answer: High engagement reflected in 105 sessions over 169 days, with positive trends in enjoyment and ease of use.  
Source: "At the end of the field trials, which lasted 169 days in total, a total of 105 telepresence services were delivered."  

## acceptance  
Answer: Average acceptance score improved from 61.17 (T0) to 70.83 (TF)  
Source: "The mean overall score for the ad-hoc questionnaires (12 items) was 61.17 (SD=12.30) at T0 and 70.83 (SD=9.79) at TF."  

## trust  
Answer: Positive trend in trust scores after usage, with significant improvement in perceived telepresence ability.  
Source: "After using the robot, subjects generally feel more comfortable, confident, and less scared about it."  

## key_findings  
Answer: Expectations influence real usability/acceptance; field trials improve trust and ease of use; positive attitude correlates with better outcomes.  
Source: "Expectation and prejudice seem to play a key role, not only in determining the perceived usability/acceptance of a robot but also concerning the real usability and acceptance after the interaction with the robot."  

## additional_info  
Answer: Limitations include small sample size (10 participants) and lack of demographic influence analysis.  
Source: "Based on our small sample, it seems that there is no relationship between gender, age, educational level, and family composition in any measurements."  

## testing_context  
Answer: Private homes of elderly participants  
Source: "The proposed protocol is divided into three main phases... the other two (i.e. training in situ and field test) took place at the user's private home."
