## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals aged 65+, caregivers, and robotics experts
Source: Participants were recruited on a voluntary basis from the elderly people living in apartments that are part of a shelter house that provides assisted living in Plymouth.

## sample_size
Answer: 16 participants (4 males and 12 females)
Source: In total, 16 participants took part in the experiment (4 males and 12 females).

## country
Answer: Plymouth, UK
Source: Participants were recruited on a voluntary basis from the elderly people living in apartments that are part of a shelter house that provides assisted living in Plymouth.

## age
Answer: Age range was between 65 and 86 (Mean=73.6, Standard Deviation=5.9)
Source: The age range was between 65 and 86 (Mean=73.6, Standard Deviation=5.9).

## gender
Answer: 4 males and 12 females
Source: In total, 16 participants took part in the experiment (4 males and 12 females).

## demographic_background
Answer: Elderly people living in assisted living facilities, with varying levels of technology familiarity
Source: The people taking part in this experiment declared themselves mostly not confident with technology (57%) or comparable to a medium-level user (37%), who is used to deal with computers only to stay in touch with family members.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Participants expressed the need for non-intrusive monitoring and comfort with robotic guidance for cognitive tests.
Source: Comments like "It is useful to have the possibility to do this at home and not to move to go to the hospital" or "It is a robot, it doesn't make any difference" were reported by such users.

## application_context
Answer: Home-based monitoring for early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
Source: The work presented in this paper aims at developing a non-intrusive system, to be deployed in the house of the elderly, that helps the detection of early signs of MCI.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use during experimental sessions, with each session lasting approximately 20 minutes
Source: The average amount of time for the participants to complete the tests was 20 minutes.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews and Likert-based questionnaires
Source: After the completion of the last cognitive test, the second stage started. In this phase, the investigator interviewed the participants on their experience with the whole system, through a questionnaire composed of 10 questions, five of them open and five Likert-based.

## care_type
Answer: Cognitive assessment and monitoring
Source: The work presented in this paper aims at developing a non-intrusive system, to be deployed in the house of the elderly, that helps the detection of early signs of MCI.

## robot_type
Answer: Assistive mobile robot (Giraff platform)
Source: The real-time guidance is carried out by an assistive mobile robot: the Giraff platform.

## robot_name
Answer: Giraff
Source: The real-time guidance is carried out by an assistive mobile robot: the Giraff platform.

## design_goal
Answer: To develop a non-intrusive system for home-based cognitive monitoring and early MCI detection
Source: The work presented in this paper aims at developing a non-intrusive system, to be deployed in the house of the elderly, that helps the detection of early signs of MCI.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Guidance and supervision during cognitive tests (TMT and BT)
Source: Our objective is to equip the robot with a fully autonomous supervising behavior allowing it to explain the test's protocol, provide interventions during the test (as dictated by the test's protocol), and give a final feedback to the user.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Speech interface for instructions, real-time interaction, and non-intrusive monitoring
Source: Giraff has been equipped with a speech interface delivering instructions in an understandable way, recognizing the user's answers and requests, and producing the proper audio responses.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Slow speech recognition due to connectivity issues and repetitive question loops
Source: The main issues participants had while completing the tests were mainly due to the repetitive question and answer loops they had to engage with the robot.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Willingness to accept robotic assistance and understanding of its benefits
Source: Despite this, it is a positive result for this research to see that even people with little or no familiarity with robots and technology, after trying the system out, were convinced of the utility of it.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Privacy concerns and discomfort with robotic monitoring
Source: The main reason given by them for not accepting the real monitoring was stated to be the violation of their privacy.

## engagement
Answer: High engagement with 94% finding robot instructions clear and easy to follow
Source: When asked whether the instructions given by the robot were clear and easy to follow (Q3), 94% of participants answered positively, giving a score grater than five (between 7 and 10) to the intelligibility of the robot.

## acceptance
Answer: 75% of participants declared they would keep a robot in their houses
Source: The 75% of the participants declared they would keep a robot in their houses (Q7), if not in the immediate future, at least when they would start to realize that they need an additional monitoring system to take care of them.

## trust
Answer: 62% of participants felt comfortable with robotic monitoring
Source: Ten participants, the 62% of the total, answered with a score higher than 5 to (Q7) and (Q9).

## key_findings
Answer: Older people accept robotic guidance for cognitive tests and understand its benefits for early MCI detection
Source: Results show how older people understand the importance of additional monitoring, and accept the guidance of a robot, feeling comfortable with it explaining and supervising the tests instead of a clinician.

## additional_info
Answer: Technical issues like slow connectivity and repetitive interactions need addressing in future developments
Source: The main issues participants had while completing the tests were mainly due to the repetitive question and answer loops they had to engage with the robot.

## testing_context
Answer: Assisted living facility in Plymouth
Source: Participants were recruited on a voluntary basis from the elderly people living in apartments that are part of a shelter house that provides assisted living in Plymouth.
