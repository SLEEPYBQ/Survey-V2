## application_context
Answer: Elderly care, home care for independent living, health care, companionship, and child education
Source: "This problem will necessitate the use of social humanoids in many areas such as elderly care, home care for independent living, health care, companionship and child education because of increasing cost of personal care and education"

## methodology
Answer: Synchronous colored Petri net model and video analysis of head-gestures
Source: "We propose a new synchronous colored Petri net model and video analysis of head-gestures to identify combinations of synchronized head-motions, combining a sequence of head-motions to make Petri nets for each gesture, similarity-based graph matching to recognize the gestures, and generate archived gestures using a declarative model of gesture generation for human verification."

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid robot
Source: "Social robots need to be constrained to human-like form and positive behavior for social acceptance"

## design_goal
Answer: To train humanoids to learn human head-gestures by observation and generate gestures in real-time
Source: "Our goal is to provide social robots capability to automatically learn and generate gestures in real-time using gesture capture and analysis without retraining if the domain, such as culture or set of individual actors change."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Head-gesture recognition and generation
Source: "This paper focuses on training humanoids to learn human head-gestures by observation."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: High-level accuracy and robustness in detecting places, transitions, and synchronization for constructing the proposed synchronous colored Petri net model
Source: "The experimental result shows that the methodology provides a high-level of accuracy and robustness in detecting places, transitions and synchronization needed for constructing the proposed synchronous colored Petri net based model for recognizing conversational head-gestures."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include integration with conversation hand-gestures, gaze, and lip-motion at syllable level; separation between referential and conversational head-gestures; automated adaptation of parameters in real-time; and predicting incomplete or delayed motions in gestures of physically challenged persons.
Source: "Model needs improvements in following areas: 1) integration with conversation hand-gestures, gaze and lip-motion at syllable level; 2) separation between head-motion to point (or look) at an object (referential gestures) in the scene and conversational head-gestures; 3) automated adaptation of parameters in real-time in natural scenario; 4) predicting incomplete or delayed motions in gestures of physically challenged persons, including elderly persons."
