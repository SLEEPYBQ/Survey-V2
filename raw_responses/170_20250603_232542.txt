## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals aged 67+, caregivers, and robotics experts  
Source: The study was conducted with 30 participants between the ages of 67 and 90 (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29; 10 male, 20 female).  

## sample_size  
Answer: 30 cognitively-intact older adults  
Source: We conducted 30 in-depth interviews with cognitively-intact older adults in their own homes.  

## country  
Answer: Israel  
Source: The study was conducted with 30 participants between the ages of 67 and 90 (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29; 10 male, 20 female).  

## age  
Answer: 67 to 90 years (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29)  
Source: The study was conducted with 30 participants between the ages of 67 and 90 (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29; 10 male, 20 female).  

## gender  
Answer: 10 male, 20 female  
Source: The study was conducted with 30 participants between the ages of 67 and 90 (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29; 10 male, 20 female).  

## demographic_background  
Answer: Participants lived in apartments (83%) or private homes (17%); 60% were completely independent, 20% mainly independent, 7% slightly dependent, and 13% somewhat dependent.  
Source: All participants lived in either an apartment (83%) or private home (17%). 60% of the participants were completely independent (received no assistance), 20% were mainly independent (i.e received food catering for convenience), 7% were slightly dependent (received assistance up to once a week), and 13% were somewhat dependent (received assistance more than once a week).  

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment  
Answer: Cognitively-intact older adults (no specific impairments mentioned beyond general aging challenges).  
Source: We focused on cognitively-intact older adults with the intent to gain insights on non-clinical subpopulations.  

## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Need for independence, need for control, fear of being replaced, and need for authenticity.  
Source: Interview analysis of participants reactions to videos of six devices uncovered four user needs that can be threatened by the introduction of home robots: the need for independence, the need for control, the fear of being replaced, and the need for authenticity.  

## application_context  
Answer: Home environment for healthy older adults.  
Source: Our focus was on the benefits of technologies and robotic devices for domestic use, we further restricted our inclusion criteria to older adults who lived at home.  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## methodology  
Answer: Qualitative in-depth interviews and thematic analysis.  
Source: We employed qualitative research methods that are considered ideal for exploratory studies, supporting an inductive process leading to emerging themes without a prior hypothesis.  

## care_type  
Answer: Focus on healthy aging and non-clinical support.  
Source: We focused on cognitively-intact older adults with the intent to gain insights on non-clinical subpopulations.  

## robot_type  
Answer: PR2 (creature-like), Nao (creature-like), Paro (creature-like), ElliQ (object-like), Google Home (object-like), Cozmo (object-like).  
Source: The six devices were: PR2, Nao, ElliQ, Cozmo, Paro, and the Google Home.  

## robot_name  
Answer: PR2, Nao, ElliQ, Cozmo, Paro, Google Home  
Source: The six devices were: PR2, Nao, ElliQ, Cozmo, Paro, and the Google Home.  

## design_goal  
Answer: To address user needs (independence, control, authenticity, fear of replacement) through robot function, speech, appearance, size, proactivity, and mobility.  
Source: We provide recommendations regarding how researchers and designers of home robots can better address the user needs of healthy older adults by leveraging aspects of the robot's function, speech, appearance, size, proactivity, and mobility.  

## robot_concern_function  
Answer: Assistive (e.g., cleaning, reminders) and social (e.g., companionship).  
Source: The four aspects are: Function (assistive/service/companion), Appearance (creature/object), Mobility (mobile/stationary), and Proactivity (proactive/reactive).  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Assistive functions (e.g., cleaning, reminders) were appreciated when they did not replace meaningful activities.  
Source: Participants rejected assistance in activities they found personally meaningful, and in many cases found it as a threat to their self-efficacy, raising the concern that the robot will "replace" them.  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Social functions as the main purpose (e.g., companionship) were rejected due to perceived lack of authenticity.  
Source: Participants rejected a device that was pretending to be their friend, so much so that in some cases the idea of befriending an artificial robotic device was seen as an insult to their intelligence.  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Preference for smaller, non-intrusive robots with clear, meaningful functions.  
Source: All 15 quotes regarding size indicated a preference toward smaller devices.  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Rejection of robots that threaten independence, control, or authenticity (e.g., proactive/mobile robots or those mimicking living beings).  
Source: Participants explanations for not wanting a moving device included that a moving robot is irritating and that it would "get in the way" or "frustrate them".  

## engagement  
Answer: Mixed reactions; some participants engaged with social cues, while others rejected them.  
Source: Participants did appreciate social cues, suggesting they are important for older adults. However, they strongly conveyed their rejection when social interaction was the main function of the device.  

## acceptance  
Answer: Acceptance contingent on addressing user needs (e.g., independence, control).  
Source: Results reveal that cognitively-intact older adults are willing to adopt robotic devices into their homes, contingent upon their preferences and concerns being addressed.  

## trust  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## key_findings  
Answer: Older adults are open to home robots if designed to address their needs (independence, control, authenticity, fear of replacement).  
Source: Results reveal that cognitively-intact older adults are willing to adopt robotic devices into their homes, contingent upon their preferences and concerns being addressed.  

## additional_info  
Answer: Limitations include potential interviewer influence and video-based rather than live interaction.  
Source: Our study has several limitations. As a qualitative study based on face-to-face interviews, our interviewers could unknowingly influence an interviewee's responses.  

## testing_context  
Answer: Participants' homes.  
Source: The interviews were conducted in the living room of each of the older adults' homes.
