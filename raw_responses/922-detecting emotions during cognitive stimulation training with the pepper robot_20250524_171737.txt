## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia, therapists, and technicians
Source: "Participants were selected for the experimental study among the members of the Alzheimer Bari Association according to the evaluation of their neurophysiological state, made with MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination), and their willingness to take part to the study."

## sample_size
Answer: 8 participants
Source: "we performed a study including 8 participants that lasted 3 weeks"

## country
Answer: Italy
Source: "in collaboration with a local association ('Alzheimer Bari' ONLUS)"

## age
Answer: Ages ranged from 69 to 89 years
Source: "ID | Gender | Age | MMSE ... 1 | F | 89 | 23.4 ... 7 | F | 69 | 20 ... 8 | F | 72 | 17"

## gender
Answer: 5 females and 3 males
Source: "ID | Gender | Age | MMSE ... 1 | F | 89 | 23.4 ... 3 | M | 82 | 24.1 ... 8 | F | 72 | 17"

## demographic_background
Answer: Participants had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia, as measured by MMSE scores between 13 and 26.2
Source: "considering a MMSE score between 13 and 26.2, i.e., patients with beginning of MCI to mild stage of dementia"

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia, measured by MMSE scores ranging from 13 to 26.2
Source: "considering a MMSE score between 13 and 26.2, i.e., patients with beginning of MCI to mild stage of dementia"

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Participants needed engaging and personalized cognitive stimulation therapy; they showed positive engagement with the robot
Source: "seniors with higher MCI tended to experience mostly neutral emotions... and were less happy... than patient with a lower MMSE score. In our opinion, this could be due to the need for sessions personalized according to the MMSE"

## application_context
Answer: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) for elderly people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia
Source: "The aim of a MCI treatment is to reduce existing clinical symptoms or to delay the progression of cognitive dysfunction and prevent dementia."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 3-week program with weekly sessions of about 35 minutes each
Source: "we performed a study including 8 participants that lasted 3 weeks, with weekly meetings of about 35 min"

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative video analysis by human raters and automatic facial expression recognition (FER) model
Source: "A first analysis of the material was performed by three expert human raters... annotated the videos in terms of... emotions... we developed a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) model"

## care_type
Answer: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST)
Source: "The aim of a MCI treatment is to reduce existing clinical symptoms or to delay the progression of cognitive dysfunction and prevent dementia."

## robot_type
Answer: Semi-humanoid robot
Source: "Pepper, a semi-humanoid robot developed by SoftBank Robotics"

## robot_name
Answer: Pepper
Source: "Pepper, a semi-humanoid robot developed by SoftBank Robotics"

## design_goal
Answer: To support therapists in cognitive stimulation therapy and elicit positive emotions in participants
Source: "Our purpose was to explore their emotional response (e.g., positive or negative) in the different tasks in order to see whether participants were positively engaged by the robot during interaction."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Conveying therapeutic interventions, providing feedback, and engaging participants in memory tasks
Source: "Pepper was employed as a support to psychotherapists in cognitive stimulation sessions... Pepper shows on the tablet the image of a famous person and asks for his/her name... provides positive feedback"

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Positive feedback (e.g., thumbs up, happy body movements), engaging tasks (e.g., motor imitation, memory tasks)
Source: "Pepper provides positive feedback, showing thumbs up on the tablet and body movements manifesting how happy it was with that response"

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Lower MMSE scores (more severe impairment) correlated with more positive emotions
Source: "seniors with higher MCI tended to experience mostly neutral emotions... and were less happy... than patient with a lower MMSE score"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Higher MMSE scores (less severe impairment) correlated with fewer positive emotions
Source: "seniors with higher MCI tended to experience mostly neutral emotions... and were less happy... than patient with a lower MMSE score"

## engagement
Answer: Participants were actively engaged (65% overall, 82% in the third session)
Source: "the patients participated actively in the experiment with an engagement of 65% on the duration of the CST. In particular, the session in which participants resulted most engaged into the robot interaction is the third one with 82% of attention toward Pepper"

## acceptance
Answer: Positive acceptance; participants treated the robot as part of their group
Source: "The older adults approached the humanoid robot as a human and a stimulus to go to the center to do the cognitive stimulation program. They accepted Pepper as part of their group"

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Pepper effectively engaged participants; automatic FER model detected fewer neutral and more negative emotions than human raters; seniors with higher MCI experienced fewer positive emotions
Source: "Results show that the model was able to detect a low number of neutral emotions and a high number of negative emotions... seniors with a lower level of cognitive impairment experienced fewer positive emotions than seniors with a more severe impairment"

## additional_info
Answer: Study limited by small sample size and lack of control group due to COVID-19
Source: "A first limitation is that we could not make a comparison with a control group without the use of Pepper, as planned, due to the COVID-19 emergency. A second limitation concerns the sample size"

## testing_context
Answer: Sessions conducted in a room with participants seated in front of therapists and Pepper; videos recorded for analysis
Source: "During the training program the patients were seated in front of therapists and Pepper... another video camera was positioned in the room in order to have a front view of patients' faces"
