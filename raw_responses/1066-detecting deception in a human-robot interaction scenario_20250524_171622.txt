================================================================================

## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, robotics experts
Source: The main idea of the project is to make the robot able to learn from past experiences and to adapt its behavior to the profile (i.e., personality, cognitive disability level, emotional internal states) and preferences of the person it interacts with.

## sample_size
Answer: 51 participants (39 male and 12 female)
Source: A total of 51 participants (39 male and 12 female) agreed to take part in this experiment.

## application_context
Answer: Personalized interaction scenario between a robot and an elderly user
Source: In a personalized interaction scenario between a robot and an elderly user, there might be situations in which the robot has to ask if the user executed a certain action or not (e.g., taking medication).

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use, single session
Source: The experiment took place in a laboratory with the Meka M1 humanoid robot.

## methodology
Answer: Experimental design with control group, thermal and RGB data analysis
Source: The experiment that we designed is a pen and pencil-only calculations task.

## care_type
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid robot
Source: The experiment took place in a laboratory with the Meka M1 humanoid robot.

## robot_name
Answer: Meka M1
Source: The experiment took place in a laboratory with the Meka M1 humanoid robot.

## design_goal
Answer: To detect deception in human-robot interaction
Source: In this paper the robot will try to determine if the person it interacts with is trying to deceive it or not.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Pointing to objects, asking questions, neutral emotion expression
Source: The robot used its left hand to point to the table where the participant should sit, the paper shredder, and the two cameras. Meka robot expressed a neutral emotion on its mouth (straight line) with the help of the RGB LED matrix mounted on its head.

## key_findings
Answer: Preliminary results suggest that noninvasive physiological data analysis can determine deception in HRI.
Source: Preliminary results from the analysis of the thermal data suggest that we can use noninvasive physiological data analysis to determine if a person is trying to deceive a robot.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include the need for further analysis of thermal data and action units.
Source: We plan to extract the AUs and analyze in more detail the thermal data for each participant.

## testing_context
Answer: Laboratory setting
Source: The experiment took place in a laboratory (see Figure 1) with the Meka M1 humanoid robot.
