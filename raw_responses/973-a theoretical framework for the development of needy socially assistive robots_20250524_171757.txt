Document: 973-a theoretical framework for the development of needy socially assistive robots.md
Timestamp: 20250524_171757
================================================================================

## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, caregivers, robotics experts, and housing association experts
Source: Several trials are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of this framework in an assisted living setting. During these trials we intend to experiment with the implementation of SARs that were designed using this framework by conducting monitored tests with elderly individuals.

## sample_size
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## country
Answer: UK
Source: At present, our research team is collaborating with experts at Gloucester City Homes (GCH) to confirm the validity of these expectations.

## age
Answer: Elderly individuals (specific age range not provided)
Source: Although this framework aims to facilitate the development of a needy SAR for a broad set of users, it has been tailored towards the elderly who are anticipated to be the primary demographic.

## gender
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## demographic_background
Answer: Independently living, high-risk individuals such as the elderly or those living with frailty
Source: Independently living, high-risk individuals, such as the elderly or those living with frailty, can suffer from a lack of interaction.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Frailty and potential hearing disabilities
Source: Elderly people in particular are hindered by this as speech may be slurred or otherwise difficult for the device to understand. This is compounded by a lack of support for multiple languages, as individuals would rather communicate through their first language, which may not be possible.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for companionship, reduction of loneliness, and interaction without the downsides of pet ownership
Source: Pets are regularly used to aid with healthy ageing as they provide benefits linked to improving the symptoms of mental health issues, reducing loneliness and isolation. Furthermore, high-risk individuals can find it difficult to take care of animals due to safety concerns.

## application_context
Answer: Assisted living settings and housing associations
Source: Several trials are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of this framework in an assisted living setting.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Surveys and interviews
Source: Surveys and interviews will be conducted in order to appraise whether this framework was able to successfully assist in the design of an effective needy SAR that is readily accepted.

## care_type
Answer: Social companionship and assistance for independent living
Source: SARs do not have the downsides of pets and recent studies have indicated that they are capable of filling a companionship role, allowing them to act as a pet substitute.

## robot_type
Answer: Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) with needy characteristics
Source: We suggest a theoretical framework for the design and development of a "needy" socially assistive robot (SAR) for the elderly.

## robot_name
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## design_goal
Answer: To create a needy SAR that is readily accepted by elderly users and results in positive care outcomes
Source: Our hypothesis is that a needy SAR will be more readily accepted by those that require them and would result in overall more positive care outcomes when compared to a non needy alternative.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Interaction through speech synthesis, gestures, or text; expressing emotions and personality
Source: These requests do not need to be limited to speech synthesis, as neediness can be expressed in many different forms, such as through gestures or text.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Friendly and casual communication, expressing regret and vulnerability, showing basic human-like characteristics
Source: Interaction through friendly and casual means, such as using informal language, can greatly influence the enjoyment that users receive from using SARs. Expressing regret and vulnerability by asking for support has shown to increase overall acceptance by endearing the robot to the user.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Excessive dependence, unclear speech recognition, lack of support for multiple languages
Source: Therefore, a robot must not request more support than is viable for the user to provide. Elderly people in particular are hindered by this as speech may be slurred or otherwise difficult for the device to understand. This is compounded by a lack of support for multiple languages.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Preference for informal language and personalized interactions
Source: Interaction through friendly and casual means, such as using informal language, can greatly influence the enjoyment that users receive from using SARs. Personalising less functionally significant aspects, such as the voice, can help to appeal to different demographics and increase overall enjoyment.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Hearing disabilities and difficulty with speech recognition
Source: Enunciation from speech-based robots needs to be clear, as the elderly are more likely to have hearing disabilities.

## engagement
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## acceptance
Answer: Higher rate of acceptance when needy traits are correctly integrated
Source: Studies indicate that the creation of SARs with "needy" characteristics results in a greater rate of affection and overall acceptance.

## trust
Answer: Increased trust when robots express regret and vulnerability
Source: Expressing regret and vulnerability by asking for support has shown to increase overall acceptance by endearing the robot to the user.

## key_findings
Answer: A theoretical framework with 7 design considerations for creating a needy SAR that is readily accepted by elderly users
Source: In this paper, we have suggested a framework with 7 design considerations that current evidence indicates will allow for the successful creation of a SAR with needy traits.

## additional_info
Answer: The framework is primarily targeted at the elderly but may be suitable for a general user base; cultural, age, and gender differences need further exploration
Source: While this framework is primarily targeted at the elderly, many of the factors contained within it are suitable for implementation into SARs for a general user base. Work will need to be done to ascertain whether the traits in this framework are equally important to different cultures, age ranges and genders.

## testing_context
Answer: Assisted living settings and housing associations in the UK
Source: Several trials are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of this framework in an assisted living setting. At present, our research team is collaborating with experts at Gloucester City Homes (GCH) to confirm the validity of these expectations.
