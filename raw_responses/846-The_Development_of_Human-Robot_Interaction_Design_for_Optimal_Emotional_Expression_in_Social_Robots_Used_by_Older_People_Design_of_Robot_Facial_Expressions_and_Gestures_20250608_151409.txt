## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, robotics experts
Source: "Ten elderly individuals (four men and six women) aged 65 years or older—which is the age range of the intended users of our robot—participated in the group interviews." and "a seven-point questionnaire was administered to ten experts (five men and five women) in the field of robotics."

## sample_size
Answer: 20 prospective users for face-type preference evaluation, 30 prospective users for robot face design evaluation, 25 prospective users for integrated facial expression and gesture design evaluation
Source: "We conducted a face-type preference evaluation using a seven-point scale with 20 prospective users of the social robot" and "This preference evaluation was conducted using a seven-point scale with 30 prospective users of social robots" and "A total of 25 potential elderly users were presented with a video of the HRI design"

## key_findings
Answer: Developed facial expression and gesture designs for six emotions (Loving, Joyful, Upbeat, Hopeful, Concerned, Grateful) in social robots interacting with elderly individuals, providing guidelines for designing human-friendly robot facial expressions and gestures
Source: "As a result of the study, we developed facial expression and gesture designs for six emotions (Loving, Joyful, Upbeat, Hopeful, Concerned, Grateful) in social robots interacting with elderly individuals. The results provide guidelines for designing human-friendly robot facial expressions and gestures, thus enabling social robots to form deep emotional bonds with users."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include presenting a single facial expression and gesture for each emotion without accounting for variations in emotional intensity; future research should develop a series of facial expressions and gestures categorizing emotional intensity
Source: "Nevertheless, this study is constrained by the fact that it presents a single facial expression and gesture for each emotion, which does not account for the potential variations in emotional intensity. Future research should develop a series of facial expressions and gestures that will categorize emotional intensity and further refine the emotional expression of social robots."
