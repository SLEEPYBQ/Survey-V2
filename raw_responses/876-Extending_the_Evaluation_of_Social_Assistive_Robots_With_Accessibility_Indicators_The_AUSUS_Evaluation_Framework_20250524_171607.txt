## involved_stakeholder  
Answer: Elderly individuals aged 55+, clinicians (doctors and physiotherapists), and robotics experts  
Source: Eight patients were involved in the evaluation. They had different age-related impairments... Seventeen clinicians participated in the evaluation, of whom six were primary care doctors (35.3%), four were rehabilitation specialists (23.5%), and seven were physiotherapists (41.2%).  

## sample_size  
Answer: 8 elderly participants and 17 clinicians  
Source: Eight patients were involved in the evaluation... Seventeen clinicians participated in the evaluation...  

## country  
Answer: Spain  
Source: The evaluation was carried out in Seville, Spain...  

## age  
Answer: Elderly participants: mean age 81.37 ± 12.07 years; Clinicians: mean age 32.35 ± 7.13 years  
Source: The mean age was 81.37 ± 12.07 years... The clinicians presented a mean age of 32.35 ± 7.13 years...  

## gender  
Answer: Elderly participants: 7 women (87.5%), 1 man (12.5%); Clinicians: 12 women (70.6%), 5 men (29.4%)  
Source: There were seven women (87.5%) and one man (12.5%)... Out of the 17 clinicians, 12 were women (70.6%) and 5 were men (29.4%).  

## demographic_background  
Answer: Elderly participants had varying motor, hearing, visual, and cognitive impairments; Clinicians included primary care doctors, rehabilitation specialists, and physiotherapists  
Source: They had different age-related impairments: three of them with light hearing impairments and one with medium hearing impairments; three of them with light visual impairments and one with medium visual impairments; and three of them with light cognitive impairments... Seventeen clinicians participated in the evaluation, of whom six were primary care doctors (35.3%), four were rehabilitation specialists (23.5%), and seven were physiotherapists (41.2%).  

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment  
Answer: Elderly participants had light to medium hearing, visual, and cognitive impairments; some used wheelchairs or walkers  
Source: They had different age-related impairments: three of them with light hearing impairments and one with medium hearing impairments; three of them with light visual impairments and one with medium visual impairments; and three of them with light cognitive impairments... user1: In a wheelchair from a recent hip fracture; user2: Uses a walker to move around due to senile impairment...  

## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Elderly participants needed adaptable interaction modalities (voice, touch screen, remote control); clinicians needed efficient and accurate geriatric assessment tools  
Source: Each patient could choose the interaction modality that better corresponds to his/her abilities and capabilities... The robot's main aim is to interact with persons with diabetes, even if most of them would have age-related disabilities, the most important disability to take into account is the visual disability directly related to diabetes.  

## application_context  
Answer: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in hospitals and retirement homes  
Source: CLARC [27] is a robot aimed to perform CGA in hospitals and retirement homes.  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: Short-term use; each test with the robot lasted about 30 minutes  
Source: Each test with the robot lasted (in total) about 30 min.  

## methodology  
Answer: Mixed methods: heuristic evaluations, user tests, structured interviews, observations, and quantitative data collection  
Source: Quantitative and qualitative methods were complementarily combined to answer the research questions... heuristic evaluation... test and structured interviews... objective data... observations...  

## care_type  
Answer: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA)  
Source: CLARC [27] is a robot aimed to perform CGA in hospitals and retirement homes.  

## robot_type  
Answer: Socially assistive robot (SAR)  
Source: This article is focused on socially assistive robots (SARs), defined as robots whose main goal is to provide assistance to human users through social interaction [43].  

## robot_name  
Answer: CLARC  
Source: CLARC [27] is a robot aimed to perform CGA in hospitals and retirement homes.  

## design_goal  
Answer: To provide assistance through social interaction, focusing on accessibility, usability, social acceptance, user experience, and societal impact  
Source: The main contributions of this article are as follows. First, the identification of accessibility as a necessary dimension to take into account in HRI evaluation... Second, the extension of USUS... to create AUSUS (Accessibility, Usability, Social acceptance, User experience, and Societal impact).  

## robot_concern_function  
Answer: Multimodal interaction (voice, touch screen, remote control), performing Barthel test for CGA  
Source: The robot was able to: introduce the test to the user, ask the clinical test questions (by voice and showing the question and possible answers in a display), and receive the answer from the user (by voice, touch screen, or remote control).  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Multimodal interaction, adaptable content, error prevention, and assistance features  
Source: It provided multiple modalities to interact (voice, touch screen, and remote control) in order to adapt to user's needs... Error prevention and suggestions were always taken into account.  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Non-configurable hardware components, missing captions, robotic voice, lack of assistive technology compatibility  
Source: The location of some hardware components is not configurable... Some captions were missing... The robot's voice was not very natural (robotic voice)... The robot does not provide any way to plug other input devices or assistive technology.  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Higher technology literacy, familiarity with robots, and fewer impairments  
Source: user4: Advanced user (continuously)... user7: Cell phone and computer (Internet navigation)...  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Lower technology literacy, cognitive or physical impairments, and negative prior attitudes toward robots  
Source: user3: light cognitive impairment... user5: medium hearing impairment...  

## engagement  
Answer: High engagement observed; some users found the robot easy to use  
Source: I found the robot easy to use (mean 5.00)... The robot's explanations of what I had to do were clear and understandable (mean 5.00).  

## acceptance  
Answer: High acceptance among clinicians and elderly participants; some initial hesitation due to unfamiliarity  
Source: The subjective opinion of the patients related to the system's accessibility was surveyed in a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)... I think the robot is useful for CGA assessments (mean 4.71).  

## trust  
Answer: Gradual trust development observed; some users reported errors during interaction  
Source: I found errors during the interaction (mean 2.00)... The robot's voice was not very natural (robotic voice) and the pronunciation was not the best for some specific sentences.  

## key_findings  
Answer: Accessibility is a critical factor in HRI; AUSUS framework effectively evaluates SARs; CLARC robot showed high usability but needs improvements in voice and hardware adaptability  
Source: The main contributions of this article are as follows. First, the identification of accessibility as a necessary dimension to take into account in HRI evaluation... The use of a better and more human-like text-to-speech model is recommended.  

## additional_info  
Answer: High cost of evaluation, recruitment challenges, and session duration were noted as limitations  
Source: One of the main difficulties found during the evaluation process was the high cost of organizing and doing the evaluation itself due to the mixed methodological approach... Users recruitment... Duration of structured interviews... Methods' cost...  

## testing_context  
Answer: Retirement home and hospital (Virgen del Rocío University Hospital in Seville, Spain)  
Source: The evaluation was carried out in Seville, Spain, in two different scenarios: a retirement home and at the Virgen del Rocío University Hospital.
