## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals aged 78-88, caregivers, and research staff
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman. We asked her daughter lived in different prefecture, a care worker of Mon-san Nagasaki, and our research staff to register the LINE account for PaPeRo.

## sample_size
Answer: 3 elderly participants (78, 87, and 88 years old)
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman.

## country
Answer: Japan
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016 at the house for the elderly with the care service, named Mon-san Nagasaki in Togitsu-machi, Nagasaki prefecture.

## age
Answer: 78, 87, and 88 years old
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman.

## gender
Answer: 2 women and 1 man
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman.

## demographic_background
Answer: Elderly individuals who could not use smartphones, living in a care service facility
Source: They could not use smartphones. We installed PaPeRo at the living room of each test subjects and connected PaPeRo with the Internet through Wi-Fi router.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly people want to have more tight connection with society and communicate with younger generation interactively via SNS without using smartphones.
Source: Current services are not enough for elderly people who want to have more tight connection with society. Using the SNS Agency Robot, elderly people can communicate with younger generation interactively via LINE using neither smartphones nor personal computers.

## application_context
Answer: Interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via LINE in a care service facility
Source: We proposed a SNS Agency Robot that can be used for the interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via existing Social Networking Service (SNS).

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use over 6 weeks with daily interactions
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016 at the house for the elderly with the care service.

## methodology
Answer: Demonstration experiment with prototype system evaluation
Source: We confirmed the effectiveness of the message destination estimation through the demonstration experiment at the house for the elderly with the care service.

## care_type
Answer: Remote communication and social interaction support
Source: We proposed a SNS Agency Robot that can be used for the interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via existing Social Networking Service (SNS).

## robot_type
Answer: Human-type robot
Source: We used PaPeRo, which stands for "Partner-type-Personal-Robot", is a personal robot developed by Japanese firm NEC Corporation.

## robot_name
Answer: PaPeRo
Source: We used PaPeRo, which stands for "Partner-type-Personal-Robot", is a personal robot developed by Japanese firm NEC Corporation.

## design_goal
Answer: Simple voice-operated interface for elderly people to use SNS without smartphones
Source: This robot system has been implemented on a cloud service and a single board computer embedded in a human-type robot, which is equipped with a microphone, camera, speaker, sensors, and network access function, so that elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via SNS without using smartphones.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Voice-based message exchange via LINE with destination estimation
Source: We proposed a message exchange learning-type destination estimation method that enables elderly people not to express a message destination address explicitly.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Voice operation, automatic message destination estimation, and response notification via robot's ears shining
Source: The ears of PaPeRo will shine, so that the elderly person can know that new messages have arrived. When the elderly person closes to PaPeRo, PaPeRo starts to speak automatically.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Elderly people who want to communicate with younger generation but cannot use smartphones
Source: They could not use smartphones. Using the SNS Agency Robot, elderly people can communicate with younger generation interactively via LINE using neither smartphones nor personal computers.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Physical condition worsening during experiment period
Source: Unfortunately, the physical condition of 87 years old man and 88 years old woman turned worse during experiment period.

## engagement
Answer: Test subjects enjoyed using PaPeRo initially
Source: Just after starting experiment, all test subjects enjoyed using PaPeRo.

## acceptance
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: The message destination estimation probability achieved more than 80% at the last period of the demonstration experiment, proving the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Source: In the results of the demonstration experiment, we confirmed that we were able to achieve the message destination estimation probability of more than 80% at the last period of the demonstration experiment. This result proves the effectiveness of our proposed method.

## additional_info
Answer: Physical condition of two participants worsened during experiment, limiting evaluation to one subject. Speech recognition accuracy was 90.5%.
Source: Unfortunately, the physical condition of 87 years old man and 88 years old woman turned worse during experiment period. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the communication history of Ms. A. Speech recognition accuracy was 90.5%.

## testing_context
Answer: House for the elderly with care service in Nagasaki prefecture, Japan
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016 at the house for the elderly with the care service, named Mon-san Nagasaki in Togitsu-machi, Nagasaki prefecture in Japan.
