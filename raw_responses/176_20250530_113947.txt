## demographic_background
Answer: Most participants had an academic degree (30% bachelor's, 30% postgraduate, remainder high school or other); all used technology regularly (smartphones and computers); 69% used a computer every day, 27% almost every day; 80% reported high independence in household chores, 20% moderate independence; 84% had no previous experience with robots.
Source: "Most of the participants had an academic degree: 30% (8/26) at bachelor's level and 30% (8/26) at the postgraduate level. The remainder (10/26) had high school or another level of education. All participants used technology regularly; they all had smartphones and computers. Sixty-nine percent (18/26) of the participants used a computer every day, and 27% (7/26) used one almost every day. However, most of the participants (84%, 22/26) did not have previous experience with robots. Eighty percent (21/26) indicated that they had high independence in performing household chores; the other 20% (5/26) reported moderate independence."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs include maintaining and improving independence and quality of life through physical and cognitive training; expectations include easy-to-use, motivating, and customizable training systems; some participants desired more challenging exercises and clearer separation or integration of cognitive and physical training.
Source: "Physical and cognitive training can maintain and improve older adults' independence and quality of life... many people lack access to suitable programs or the motivation to pursue them... several younger participants noted in informal conversation after the experiment that they thought the experience with the robotic system was pleasant, but because they were physically active, the exercises provided by the system were not challenging for them. They believed the robot could benefit people who were less active or older. Accordingly, when designing a robotic system for older adults, it is clearly important to customize the system to the specific user needs and especially to ensure that the exercise difficulty matches (or slightly exceeds) the user's capability... Another issue that was raised by the participants was that the insertion of cognitive training in the middle of the physical training was problematic and confusing."

## application_context
Answer: The envisioned application context is independent use by older adults in their homes for physical and cognitive training.
Source: "The system was designed to be compact, robust, easy to use and enable long-term independent operation by older adults in their homes."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Each participant underwent two training sessions (one physical only, one combined physical and cognitive); session order randomized; session duration not specified; short-term use.
Source: "Each participant underwent two training sessions: one included only physical training, and the other included both physical and cognitive training. The order of the sessions was randomized."

## methodology
Answer: Within-subjects experimental design using pre- and post-trial questionnaires (quantitative surveys), regression analysis, and descriptive statistics.
Source: "We employed a 'within subjects' experimental design in which the dependent variables were subjective measures related to the acceptance of the training, as assessed by means of questionnaires... In addition to descriptive statistics, we undertook a regression analysis of the multivariate data..."

## care_type
Answer: Physical and cognitive training for older adults.
Source: "This study suggests that social robots can satisfy this demand and presents the development of 'Gymmy', a robotic system for the physical and cognitive training of older adults."

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid mechanical-looking robot (Poppy Torso)
Source: "The system (Figure [1]) comprised a computer system with an integrated humanoid mechanical-looking robot (Poppy Torso) to demonstrate the exercises..."

## robot_name
Answer: Gymmy
Source: "The robot operated as a robotic physical coach with the capacity to demonstrate physical activity; hence, it was named 'Gymmy' to elicit the connotations of the word 'gym'."

## design_goal
Answer: To develop a compact, robust, easy-to-use robotic system enabling long-term independent operation by older adults in their homes for physical and cognitive training, with meaningful feedback and customizable to user needs.
Source: "The system was designed to be compact, robust, easy to use and enable long-term independent operation by older adults in their homes... This research also revealed the importance of customizing the system to meet the needs of different users... It also pointed to the importance of providing meaningful feedback..."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Demonstrates physical exercises, monitors user performance via camera, provides visual and auditory feedback, delivers cognitive training games via touchscreen, and offers instructions and encouragement.
Source: "The system design includes a humanoid mechanical-looking robot to demonstrate exercises, an RGB-Depth (RGB-D) camera to measure performance and a touch screen and speakers to provide instructions and feedback... Three different cognitive games were integrated into the training sessions."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Positive and instant feedback (visual and auditory), clear instructions, easy-to-use touchscreen interface, robust and reliable operation, and exercise demonstration by the robot; these features enhance motivation, engagement, and usability.
Source: "In our previous work with a robotic physical training system... it was found that continuous feedback is the preferred mode and that visual and audio feedback should be combined... The success rate in the physical exercises appeared to be a significant variable in the TAM model, having a positive association with both the perceived usefulness and the combined attitude measure. In our system, exercise success is signaled to the user by the system's feedback mechanism. When the user performs the movement correctly, the robot signals a correct repetition with verbal feedback and delivers a positive comment (such as 'well done') after eight successful repetitions. These results suggest the importance of feedback in robotic training systems."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Insertion of cognitive training in the middle of physical training was problematic and confusing for some users; lack of complexity in cognitive games; exercises not challenging enough for more active users.
Source: "Another issue that was raised by the participants was that the insertion of cognitive training in the middle of the physical training was problematic and confusing... This might be explained by the relative lack of complexity of the cognitive training or by the difficulty in discriminating between the two types of training sessions, meaning the participants did not experience much difference between the two types of sessions and thus did not express a different opinion following them... several younger participants noted... the exercises provided by the system were not challenging for them."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Older age (old-old group), higher education (postgraduate), positive or neutral attitude toward robots, and higher success rate in exercises are associated with better acceptance and use.
Source: "The old-old group perceived the robotic trainer as significantly more useful than the younger-old group... Graduate degrees had a positive association with the ease of use compared with high school education... The negative attitude toward robots ranking was also found to have a significant association with the system's acceptability... the success rate in the physical exercises appeared to be a significant variable in the TAM model, having a positive association with both the perceived usefulness and the combined attitude measure."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Negative attitude toward robots and lower education (high school or undergraduate degree) are associated with reduced acceptance and use.
Source: "The negative attitude toward robots ranking was also found to have a significant association with the system's acceptability... having an undergraduate degree resulted in a lower ranking for the ease of use in our analysis."

## engagement
Answer: Most participants (80.77%) gave high ratings of engagement with the robotic physical trainer (mean Likert score = 4.212, SD = 0.874).
Source: "Most participants (80.77%) gave high ratings of engagement with the robotic physical trainer (mean Likert score = 4.212, SD = 0.874)."

## acceptance
Answer: 46.15% perceived the system as highly useful; 46.15% indicated a clear intention to use the system in the future; acceptance was higher in the old-old group.
Source: "A substantial proportion of the participants (46.15%) perceived the robotic physical training system as highly useful... About half of the participants (46.15%) indicated a clear (i.e., rating of 4 or 5) intention to use the robotic system in the future... There was greater commitment to using the system in the old-old group (60% yielded a rating of 4 or 5)..."

## trust
Answer: 65.38% of participants expressed trust in the trainer (mean Likert score = 3.865, SD = 0.975).
Source: "Similarly, the majority (65.38%) expressed trust in the trainer (mean Likert score = 3.865, SD = 0.975)."

## key_findings
Answer: Age, education, and attitude toward robots influenced acceptance; meaningful feedback and customization to user needs are important; the system was robust and reliable in real-life environments; cognitive training inclusion did not significantly affect acceptability; success rate in exercises positively associated with acceptance.
Source: "The findings revealed that the age group, negative attitude toward robots and education were individual characteristics that associated with the acceptance of the robotic system... This research also revealed the importance of customizing the system to meet the needs of different users... It also pointed to the importance of providing meaningful feedback, especially in relation to failed exercises... the robot training system was shown to be robust and reliable outside of the laboratory... Although several participants expressed satisfaction with the cognitive training and recognized its importance, the inclusion of such training within the session did not have a significant effect on acceptability... The success rate in the physical exercises appeared to be a significant variable in the TAM model, having a positive association with both the perceived usefulness and the combined attitude measure."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include only upper-body exercises, absence of oldest-old participants, and small sample size; future work should include sitting exercises, oldest-old group, and larger samples.
Source: "The limitations of this work include the fact that only upper-body exercises were included in the system... This study is also limited by the absence of participants in the oldest-old group and by the sample size as discussed earlier. Future work should extend the investigation to this sector of the population and test the conceptual acceptance model on a larger sample."

## testing_context
Answer: Experiments were conducted in participants' own homes or at senior centers located in their vicinity.
Source: "Therefore, the sessions took place in their own homes or at senior centers located in their vicinity. For each experiment, the robot was set up at the site."
