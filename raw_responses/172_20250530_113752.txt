## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Older adults aged 65+, researchers, and facilitators
Source: "Our workshop involved 19 older adults (11F, 8M, aged 65–74 years with a mean of 67.7 years)."

## sample_size
Answer: 17 older adults
Source: "Two male participants withdrew during the first session, citing a lack of interest, which resulted in a final sample size of 17 participants."

## country
Answer: United Kingdom (UK)
Source: "Department of Computer Science, Department of Public Health, Swansea University, UK."

## age
Answer: 65–74 years (mean age 67.7 years)
Source: "Our workshop involved 19 older adults (11F, 8M, aged 65–74 years with a mean of 67.7 years)."

## gender
Answer: 11 female, 8 male (initially); 11 female, 6 male (final)
Source: "Our workshop involved 19 older adults (11F, 8M, aged 65–74 years with a mean of 67.7 years)." and "Two male participants withdrew during the first session."

## demographic_background
Answer: Older adults recruited via Swansea City Council's Ageing Well Society and Age Cymru; some had prior experience with technology or social robots.
Source: "We recruited the participants through email invitations sent via Swansea City Council's Ageing Well Society and Age Cymru." and "Three participants reported limited experiences with social robots."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Older adults expressed needs for companionship, emotional support, and social interaction to address loneliness and anxiety post-pandemic. They preferred animal-like robots with soft textures and interactive features.
Source: "Participants highlighted the importance of real-world interactions for social robots as they mentioned... reducing isolation and making me feel connected."

## application_context
Answer: Private and public environments (e.g., homes, community centers) to address emotional challenges post-pandemic.
Source: "They then explored various social robots with photos, videos and commercial products, and reported preferring companion pet robots to address their emotional issues and enhance their mental well-being."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term co-design workshop (3 hours total, divided into two sessions).
Source: "This workshop lasted three hours, including a 45-minute lunch break."

## methodology
Answer: Co-design workshop with qualitative thematic analysis and quantitative surveys (Likert scale ratings).
Source: "We employed qualitative and quantitative research methods to examine these phenomena."

## care_type
Answer: Mental well-being support (addressing loneliness, anxiety, and emotional challenges post-pandemic).
Source: "They evaluated the current social robot designs available in the literature and elicited the design preferences for a social robot to address their current emotional challenges."

## robot_type
Answer: Animal-like, humanoid, and toy-like robots (e.g., JoyForAll, Paro, Nao).
Source: "We then distributed five commercial social robots, i.e., Miro-E, Vector, JoyForAll cat, JoyForAll dog and Nao."

## robot_name
Answer: Miro-E, Vector, JoyForAll cat, JoyForAll dog, Nao
Source: "We then distributed five commercial social robots, i.e., Miro-E, Vector, JoyForAll cat, JoyForAll dog and Nao."

## design_goal
Answer: To create a companion pet robot addressing emotional challenges (loneliness, anxiety) with soft textures, medium size, and interactive features.
Source: "They specified robot designs that are soft to touch, medium sized to hold with life-like movements, which could respond and interact via touch, auditory, speech and vision and information display."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Social interaction, emotional support, enduring companionship, and accessibility features (e.g., speakers, microphones, display screens).
Source: "Participants favoured the robot's dynamic body categories to react naturally and smoothly... with a critical p=0.24, all types of interactions were desired to be incorporated into the robot design."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Soft textures, medium size, life-like movements, and multimodal interactions (touch, speech, vision) were preferred as they reduced anxiety and provided companionship.
Source: "Participants (P7, P13, P9) respectively mentioned the importance of tactile interaction with a social robot stating... making me less anxious and happy."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Hard textures, large size, and excessive mobility were disliked as they felt unnatural or intimidating.
Source: "The social robot's hard rigid feel rated the lowest."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Older adults with higher technology interest and prior robot experience were more engaged in co-design.
Source: "Participants exhibited relatively high interest in technologies with mean and standard deviations (SD) of 3.88 ± 0.9."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Lack of prior robot experience or low technology interest led to disengagement (two participants withdrew).
Source: "Two male participants withdrew during the first session, citing a lack of interest."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement in co-design activities; participants actively discussed preferences and designed robot concepts.
Source: "Older adults engaged with different types of social robots which gave them the insight to design their own robots in session 2."

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance of animal-like companion robots; humanoid designs were less preferred due to being "freaky."
Source: "The social robot's appearance strongly agrees with older adults perspective as animal-like by claiming that it is more friendly and companion, while 11 participants stated humanoid robots are freaky."

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development noted; privacy concerns were raised about cameras/microphones.
Source: "A display screen may threaten me if I don't know how to use it."

## key_findings
Answer: Older adults preferred animal-like robots with soft textures and interactive features to address post-pandemic emotional challenges. Co-design empowered them to shape robot designs.
Source: "Our results based on thematic analysis show that the impact of the pandemic on older adults' emotional challenges is persisting, and the companionship of a social robot is preferred to enhance their mental well-being."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include a small sample size and cultural homogeneity (UK-based). Ethical concerns about robot privacy were noted.
Source: "Our workshop examined the mental well-being of older adults in a local city following COVID-19, yet our qualitative transcriptions provided confidence in the results."

## testing_context
Answer: Co-design workshop conducted in an academic setting (Swansea University, UK).
