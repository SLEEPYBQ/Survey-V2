## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Older adults aged 65+, researchers, and facilitators
Source: Our workshop involved 19 older adults (11F, 8M, aged 65–74 years with a mean of 67.7 years).

## sample_size
Answer: 17 older adults
Source: Two male participants withdrew during the first session, citing a lack of interest, which resulted in a final sample size of 17 participants.

## country
Answer: Wales, UK
Source: We recruited the participants through email invitations sent via Swansea City Council's Ageing Well Society and Age Cymru, which is the national charity for older people in Wales, UK.

## age
Answer: 65–74 years (mean age 67.7 years)
Source: Our workshop involved 19 older adults (11F, 8M, aged 65–74 years with a mean of 67.7 years).

## gender
Answer: 11 females, 8 males (initial), 11 females, 6 males (final)
Source: Our workshop involved 19 older adults (11F, 8M, aged 65–74 years with a mean of 67.7 years). Two male participants withdrew during the first session.

## demographic_background
Answer: Older adults recruited via Ageing Well Society and Age Cymru; some had prior experience with technology and social robots.
Source: Three participants reported limited experiences with social robots, e.g., through smartphone apps, local day centres and an assistive slave robot some 30 years ago. The rest fourteen participants had no prior experience.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Emotional support, companionship, social interaction, and physical contact via a social robot
Source: Participants highlighted the importance of real-world interactions for social robots as they mentioned (P16, P15) respectively, "Interactions are crucial to me, as I want the robot to facilitate socialisation and connection, reducing isolation and making me feel connected" and "I am looking for a robot that can autonomously perform tasks and respond to voice commands, which would alleviate my loneliness".

## application_context
Answer: Private and public environments to address emotional challenges post-COVID-19
Source: They evaluated the current social robot designs available in the literature and elicited the design preferences for a social robot to address their current emotional challenges.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Co-design workshop lasting three hours, including a 45-minute lunch break
Source: This workshop lasted three hours, including a 45-minute lunch break.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative and quantitative methods, including co-design workshops, thematic analysis, and ANOVA tests
Source: In this paper, we employed qualitative and quantitative research methods to examine these phenomena.

## care_type
Answer: Mental well-being and emotional support
Source: They evaluated the current social robot designs available in the literature and elicited the design preferences for a social robot to address their current emotional challenges.

## robot_type
Answer: Animal-like, humanoid, and toy-like robots
Source: We then distributed five commercial social robots, i.e., Miro-E, Vector, JoyForAll cat, JoyForAll dog and Nao, see Figs. 3 and 4. This encompassed a humanoid, animal-like and toy-like robot with various feels (soft, hard, furry, etc.), sizes, behaviours and interactions.

## robot_name
Answer: Miro-E, Vector, JoyForAll cat, JoyForAll dog, Nao
Source: We then distributed five commercial social robots, i.e., Miro-E, Vector, JoyForAll cat, JoyForAll dog and Nao, see Figs. 3 and 4.

## design_goal
Answer: To address emotional challenges post-COVID-19, promote mental well-being, and incorporate user preferences
Source: They evaluated the current social robot designs available in the literature and elicited the design preferences for a social robot to address their current emotional challenges.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Social interaction, emotional support, companionship, and physical contact
Source: Participants highlighted the importance of real-world interactions for social robots as they mentioned (P16, P15) respectively, "Interactions are crucial to me, as I want the robot to facilitate socialisation and connection, reducing isolation and making me feel connected" and "I am looking for a robot that can autonomously perform tasks and respond to voice commands, which would alleviate my loneliness".

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Animal-like appearance, soft feel, medium size, dynamic body parts, facial expressions, and interactive features (speakers, microphone, camera, display screen)
Source: Our promised results indicate that older adults prefer an interactive companion pet robot, indicating the appearance of animal-like, soft-feel, medium-size, dynamic body parts, facial expressions, and all types of interaction with verbal responses, as speakers and microphone features were most desired, making the robot more natural.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Hard rigid feel, large size, and humanoid appearance (perceived as freaky)
Source: The social robot's appearance strongly agrees with older adults perspective as animal-like by claiming that it is more friendly and companion, while 11 participants stated humanoid robots are freaky and six participants claimed that a toy/abstract robot do not give a natural feeling.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: High interest in technology, prior experience with social robots, and positive emotional changes post-COVID-19
Source: Participants exhibited relatively high interest in technologies with mean and standard deviations (SD) of 3.88 ± 0.9.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Lack of interest in technology, fear of privacy invasion, and negative emotional changes post-COVID-19
Source: Two male participants withdrew during the first session, citing a lack of interest.

## engagement
Answer: High engagement in co-design activities, with participants actively designing and discussing robot preferences
Source: Older adults engaged with different types of social robots which gave them the insight to design their own robots in session 2, as shown.

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance of animal-like robots, with concerns about humanoid robots
Source: The social robot's appearance strongly agrees with older adults perspective as animal-like by claiming that it is more friendly and companion, while 11 participants stated humanoid robots are freaky and six participants claimed that a toy/abstract robot do not give a natural feeling.

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development through interaction and tactile features
Source: Participants (P7, P13, P9) respectively mentioned the importance of tactile interaction with a social robot stating, "I want a companion robot because I like its tactile interaction and feel when I am physically in contact with it, where I can cuddle it, making me less anxious and happy".

## key_findings
Answer: Older adults prefer animal-like, soft-feel, medium-sized robots for emotional support and companionship post-COVID-19.
Source: They specified robot designs that are soft to touch, medium sized to hold with life-like movements, which could respond and interact via touch, auditory, speech and vision and information display.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include a small sample size and focus on a local population; ethical concerns and cost were noted.
Source: Our workshop examined the mental well-being of older adults in a local city following COVID-19, yet our qualitative transcriptions provided confidence in the results.

## testing_context
Answer: Co-design workshop setting
Source: We followed the dialogue-labs method to run the co-design workshop, to facilitate participation for collaborative ideation and concept development by providing structured space, materials, and activities.
