================================================================================

## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals aged 65+, caregivers, and robotics experts
Source: Ten elderly individuals (four men and six women) aged 65 years or older participated

## sample_size
Answer: 35 elderly participants (21 in prototype-based, 12 in laboratory-based, and 2 in home-based experiments)
Source: We conducted three user studies by recruiting 35 elderly participants.

## country
Answer: Japan
Source: RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP), Saitama, Japan

## age
Answer: Average age of 75 in prototype-based, 70 in laboratory-based, and 74 in home-based experiments
Source: The gender distribution was 12 men and 9 women, and their average age was 75.

## gender
Answer: 12 men and 9 women in prototype-based, 6 men and 6 women in laboratory-based, and 2 women in home-based experiments
Source: The gender distribution was 12 men and 9 women, and their average age was 75.

## demographic_background
Answer: Healthy older adults recruited from a silver human resource center and research institute
Source: Twelve healthy older adults (six men and six women), whose average age was 70, recruited from a silver human resource center, participated in the experiment.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for cognitive training, social interaction, and independent living
Source: Older adults need positive social interactions and communication to stay mentally and emotionally fit.

## application_context
Answer: Home-based daily cognitive training for older adults
Source: Our research objective is to develop methods that contribute to the cognitive health of older adults in their homes.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: First encounter, short-term use, and long-term deployment with 4-minute question-answering sessions
Source: Each session involved one story and one photo; the question-answer duration was 4 min without counting the storytelling time from the system.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys, and randomized controlled trials
Source: We conducted three types of experiments to confirm whether the proposed method works as well as we thought with targeted subjects, via a step-by-step approach.

## care_type
Answer: Cognitive training
Source: This study proposes a novel design method that uses a dialogue-based robot system for cognitive training at home.

## robot_type
Answer: Dialogue robot with human-like facial expressions
Source: The robot moderates the user to ask a question and then responds to the question by changing its facial expression.

## robot_name
Answer: Bono-06
Source: We developed an original robot called Bono-06.

## design_goal
Answer: To provide daily cognitive training through dialogue, storytelling, and photo-based interactions
Source: We define challenges and requirements to meet them to realize cognitive function training through daily communication.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Storytelling, question-answering, and facial expression changes
Source: The robot moderates the user to ask a question and then responds to the question by changing its facial expression.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Storytelling and photo display provide context for dialogue, enhancing user engagement
Source: Our system displays photos and gives original stories to provide contexts for dialogue that help the robot maintain a conversation for each story.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Unnatural responses from the dialogue system and technical errors hinder user experience
Source: The resulting average score for unnaturalness was 0.61, which showed that more than half of the responses were regarded as unnatural.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Healthy older adults with higher cognitive functions and familiarity with ICT technologies
Source: We observed that healthy older adults are the primary targets of our proposed system.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Older adults with declining cognitive abilities and unfamiliarity with ICT technologies
Source: It becomes challenging for older adults with low cognitive functions to ask questions based on stories and following instructions.

## engagement
Answer: High engagement with an average of 8-9 questions per 4-minute session
Source: The average number of questions for the first and second themes was 8.25.

## acceptance
Answer: Positive acceptance with usability scores ranging from 2.25 to 3.75 on a 5-point scale
Source: The score on the questionnaire number 2 about whether they could understand the story and if it was reasonable.

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development, with some concerns about unnatural responses
Source: I felt the robot lacked the ability to read intent; I thought the answer was just from a machine, not a human.

## key_findings
Answer: The system provides effective daily cognitive training through dialogue, storytelling, and photo-based interactions, with high user engagement and acceptance.
Source: This is the first study to evaluate an integrated approach to daily cognitive training with older adults.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include the need for larger participant samples and improvements in dialogue system naturalness and scheduling flexibility.
Source: We need to conduct an experiment with a larger number of participants to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method for older adults.

## testing_context
Answer: Lab, care home, and private residence settings
Source: We performed prototype-, laboratory-, and home-based experiments.
