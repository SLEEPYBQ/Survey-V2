## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease, caregivers, and university students (speakers and observers)
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study. We recruited five university students who major in gerontology as evaluators.

## sample_size
Answer: 3 elderly participants, 5 university students (speakers and observers)
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study. We recruited five university students who major in gerontology as evaluators.

## country
Answer: Japan
Source: The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months in a group home for seniors with dementia in Osaka, Japan.

## age
Answer: 85 to 96 years old
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study.

## gender
Answer: All participants were female
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study.

## demographic_background
Answer: Seniors with Alzheimer's disease living in a group home; university students majoring in gerontology
Source: Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study. We recruited five university students who major in gerontology as evaluators.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: All participants had Alzheimer's disease; MMSE scores ranged from 0 to 17, indicating moderate to severe dementia
Source: They were all clinically diagnosed as AD. Her MMSE score were 12 (before) and 13 (after), indicating that Ms. A had moderate dementia.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Seniors needed communication support; caregivers needed tools to improve interaction with residents
Source: To maintain their motivation, caregivers need skills and adequate time to properly communicate with seniors with dementia.

## application_context
Answer: Elderly care facilities for long-term communication support
Source: We discussed the possibility of introducing a teleoperated robot into an elderly care house for long-term interaction.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Long-term deployment; sessions lasted 15 minutes each, conducted once or twice a week for 3 months
Source: The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months in a group home for seniors with dementia in Osaka, Japan.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, video analysis, and questionnaires
Source: The speaker and the observer answered questionnaires. From the video recordings, we counted the number of times that the participants used body gestures and made physical contact.

## care_type
Answer: Communication support for seniors with Alzheimer's disease
Source: We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors.

## robot_type
Answer: Teleoperated robot with a child-like appearance
Source: Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice.

## robot_name
Answer: Telenoid R3b
Source: In the Telenoid condition, the speakers controlled a Telenoid R3b.

## design_goal
Answer: To provide communication support and motivate seniors to interact
Source: We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Transmits operator's movements and voice; allows physical interaction (hugging and touching)
Source: Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Physical interaction (hugging and touching), child-like appearance, and teleoperation
Source: The small and soft body of Telenoid allows people to hold it while having conversation through it, allowing one to have communication with multiple modalities including visual and tactile sensations besides dialogue.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited non-verbal communication for operators
Source: Non-verbal information, like holding hands and eye contact, is important, but communicating this through Telenoid was difficult.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Seniors treated Telenoid as a child, leading to more relaxed communication
Source: She seemed to treat Telenoid like a child, which allowed her to communicate in a more relaxed manner.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe dementia reduced verbal communication effectiveness
Source: Ms. C has severe AD, verbal communication is more difficult with her.

## engagement
Answer: Seniors showed positive reactions and physical interaction with Telenoid
Source: The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid.

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance, especially for seniors with moderate dementia
Source: Both became less nervous while communicating with Telenoid from the time they were first introduced to it.

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development observed in some participants
Source: They became less nervous while communicating with Telenoid from the time they were first introduced to it.

## key_findings
Answer: Telenoid improved communication for seniors with moderate dementia and supported non-verbal interaction for those with severe dementia
Source: The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include lack of comparison with other robots and potential cross-effects between conditions
Source: The experiment did not prove the effect of Telenoid itself, since the speakers had conversations both with Telenoid and face-to-face.

## testing_context
Answer: Group home for seniors with dementia in Osaka, Japan
Source: The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months in a group home for seniors with dementia in Osaka, Japan.
