## cognitive_and_physical_impairment  
Answer: Memory issues and physical problems are mentioned, but no standardized scores or qualitative terms are provided.  
Source: "Suppose, for example, that from the interaction with an elderly user u it emerges that the person suffers from memory problems while is free of major physical problems."  

## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Needs include reducing isolation, cognitive/physical rehabilitation, and remote teleoperation for caregivers.  
Source: "enable mitigating the isolation of elderly people living alone" and "administer, autonomously, a cognitive rehabilitation therapy to a user."  

## application_context  
Answer: Home care for elderly individuals  
Source: "The goal of the project consists in creating a holistic system that includes multivariate services that range from monitoring the physiological measurements of primary user (i.e., the older adult at home)."  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: Long-term deployment with personalized plans, but no specific duration or frequency is mentioned.  
Source: "the planner executor will notify the start of each task at specific time" and "Generating a personalised plan that manages the coordination among the different activities that might take place within a house."  

## methodology  
Answer: Integration of AI technologies (Reasoning, Planning, Machine Learning, NLP) with robotics  
Source: "different artificial intelligence technologies such as Reasoning, Knowledge Representation, Automated Planning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Perception and Navigation must coexist on limited hardware."  

## care_type  
Answer: Cognitive and physical rehabilitation, telepresence, and remote monitoring  
Source: "personalized physical and cognitive rehabilitation, reminders on the medicines to be taken or on physiological measurements."  

## robot_type  
Answer: Mobile telepresence robot with video conferencing system  
Source: "Mobile Telepresence Robots represent a class of robotic platforms, characterized by a video conferencing system mounted on a mobile robotic base."  

## robot_name  
Answer: N/A  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## design_goal  
Answer: Enhance autonomy through AI integration, personalized services, and adaptability to dynamic environments  
Source: "This work aims to lay the foundations to increase the autonomy of mobile telepresence robots, both by supporting teleoperation through shared approaches and offering services to users in total autonomy."  

## robot_concern_function  
Answer: Navigation, cognitive/physical exercise administration, emotion detection, and telepresence  
Source: "the ability to navigate in a dynamic environment, the ability to recognize the user and to follow him/her in order to offer, day by day, the planned cognitive exercise."  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Personalized planning, contextualized navigation, emotion detection, and obstacle avoidance  
Source: "the robot's autonomy can vary over time by including the possibility of inserting the human operator in the loop" and "the robot interprets with respect to the environment knowledge and avoids executing wrong commands."  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Limited hardware capabilities hinder advanced perception and computational tasks  
Source: "the main barrier of building advancing sensing services is associated with the limited capabilities of the hardware."  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Familiarity with technology for secondary users (e.g., caregivers)  
Source: "supporting their teleoperation by people typically not very familiar with technology (e.g., including family members of the assisted persons, doctors and nurses)."  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
