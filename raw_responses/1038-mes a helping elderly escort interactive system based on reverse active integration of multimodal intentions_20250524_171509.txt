## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, caregivers, and technical solution providers
Source: "Ten elderly individuals (four men and six women) aged 65 years or older participated"

## sample_size
Answer: 10 elderly participants
Source: "the experimental subjects were 10 users (average age: 75 years old) including 4 males and 6 females"

## country
Answer: China
Source: "University of Jinan, Department of Information Science and Engineering, Jinan 250022, China"

## age
Answer: Average age of 75 years old
Source: "the experimental subjects were 10 users (average age: 75 years old)"

## gender
Answer: 4 males and 6 females
Source: "the experimental subjects were 10 users (average age: 75 years old) including 4 males and 6 females"

## demographic_background
Answer: Elderly living alone or with working children, urban high-rise residential buildings
Source: "who lived in high-rise residential buildings in urban communities alone during the day time (living together with their children who however needed to work during the day time) or in long-term (not living together with their children)"

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Decline in language expression ability, memory, and other abilities
Source: "in response to the elderly's decline in language expression ability, memory, and other abilities"

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Natural interaction, accurate intention extraction, and harmony in human-computer interaction
Source: "improving the quality of elderly care, making the interaction between the elderly and the robot more natural, improving the accuracy in intention extraction from fuzzy expression, as well as breaking the traditional 'master-slave' human-computer interaction and improving the harmony of human-computer interaction"

## application_context
Answer: Elderly escort and care in homes or nursing homes
Source: "the family planning policy in the last decade triggered a series of problems such as labor contraction and aging"

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use with multiple interactions per session
Source: "In the 100 experiments, the 10 participants expressed intention 145 times in total (multiple intentions might be expressed in one experiment)"

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys, and experimental evaluation
Source: "the evaluation experiment was conducted by a robot Pepper embedded with the system"

## care_type
Answer: Elderly escort and daily assistance
Source: "a helping elderly escort interactive system based on reverse active integration of multimodal intentions (MES)"

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid smart robot
Source: "the experimental robot was a humanoid smart robot Pepper developed by SoftBank Robotics"

## robot_name
Answer: Pepper
Source: "the experimental robot was a humanoid smart robot Pepper developed by SoftBank Robotics"

## design_goal
Answer: Improve interaction quality, accuracy in intention extraction, and harmony in human-computer interaction
Source: "improving the quality of elderly care, making the interaction between the elderly and the robot more natural, improving the accuracy in intention extraction from fuzzy expression, as well as breaking the traditional 'master-slave' human-computer interaction and improving the harmony of human-computer interaction"

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Multimodal intention extraction, trust degree evaluation, and active interaction
Source: "the system can understand the intention of the elderly based on scene perception and three-modal information: speech, gesture, and posture"

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Multimodal intention extraction, reverse active interaction, and trust degree evaluation
Source: "the system can understand the intention of the elderly based on scene perception and three-modal information: speech, gesture, and posture"

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Clear expression and consistent multimodal input
Source: "the clearer the modal information is, the greater the sum of intention synthesis probability and intention set synthesis probability, and the higher the reliability of modal identification, the greater the trust degree"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Fuzzy expression and inconsistent multimodal input
Source: "due to the uneven level of education or the decline in expression ability with age, the elderly's expression by speech, gesture, and posture may not be as coherent and fluent as young people"

## engagement
Answer: High engagement with multiple interactions per session
Source: "In the 100 experiments, the 10 participants expressed intention 145 times in total (multiple intentions might be expressed in one experiment)"

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance with 97.2% accuracy in intention extraction
Source: "the system successfully extracted the participants' intention 141 times, with an accuracy of 97.2%"

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development through trust degree evaluation
Source: "the trust degree evaluation mechanism makes the intention extraction more accurate, the interaction more harmonious, and improves the intelligence of the elderly escort robot"

## key_findings
Answer: The MES system improves interaction quality, accuracy in intention extraction, and harmony in human-computer interaction
Source: "the MES has more prominent advantages than other related work in the elderly care environment"

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include low efficiency in human-computer cooperation and lack of facial expression integration
Source: "the human-computer cooperation still has low efficiency and sometimes needs multiple reverse input interactions between human and robot in order to have the robot understand the real intention of the user"

## testing_context
Answer: Simulated living room and bedroom in a laboratory
Source: "the experiments were mainly conducted in the simulated living room and bedroom of a laboratory"
