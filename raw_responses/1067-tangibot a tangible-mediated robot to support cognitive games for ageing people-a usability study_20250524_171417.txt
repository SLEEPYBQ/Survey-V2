## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals with varying levels of cognitive impairment (none, mild, severe), caregivers, and therapists
Source: Forty-six residents of three different retirement homes were asked to participate in this study... The therapists in charge of the subjects classified them into three groups according to their level of cognitive impairment: none, mild, and severe.

## sample_size
Answer: 40 elderly participants (16 with no cognitive impairment, 12 with mild, and 12 with severe)
Source: Whereas four of them refused even to try and two more quit after the first contact with the platform, the remaining forty agreed to participate until the end of the experiment.

## country
Answer: Spain
Source: ISSI Group, Department of Computer Systems and Computation (DSIC), Universitat Politècnica de València, 46022 Valencia, Spain

## age
Answer: Ages ranged from 57 to 95 years (M = 81.33, SD = 8.48)
Source: Their ages ranged from 57 to 95 years (M = 81.33, SD = 8.48).

## gender
Answer: 32 females and 8 males
Source: Their ages ranged from 57 to 95 years (M = 81.33, SD = 8.48) and thirty-two were females.

## demographic_background
Answer: Residents of retirement homes; cognitive impairment levels (none, mild, severe); no additional demographic details provided
Source: Forty-six residents of three different retirement homes were asked to participate in this study... The therapists in charge of the subjects classified them into three groups according to their level of cognitive impairment: none, mild, and severe.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Cognitive impairment levels: none (independent, normal reasoning), mild (early dementia symptoms, capable of conversation/routines), severe (unable to maintain meaningful conversation, highly defective short-term memory). No physical impairment details provided.
Source: Those with no cognitive impairment were totally independent and capable of reasoning normally. Those diagnosed with mild cognitive issues presented early symptoms of dementia, but were still capable of maintaining a conversation and performing most of their routines. Finally, the ones selected with severe cognitive impairment were unable to maintain a meaningful conversation and their short-term memory was highly defective, although they were still capable of understanding basic instructions.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs: intuitive and appealing interactions, cognitive training, socialization. Expectations: positive emotional reactions, usability, engagement.
Source: The idea of ageing people and technology being incompatible is simply a cliché... They do have the ability, although not necessarily the necessity... The platform could be a useful tool for triggering positive emotional reactions even in the case of persons with severe cognitive impairments.

## application_context
Answer: Cognitive games for elderly to train cognitive abilities, foster socialization, and improve quality of life
Source: We present Tangibot, a tangible-mediated robot aimed at enabling more intuitive and appealing interactions... It also enables natural interactions through tangible manipulations and has the potential to foster socialization and the training of cognitive abilities that can improve the elders' quality of life.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use; session duration not specified; tasks repeated four times
Source: Each user was asked to perform three different tasks... Each task was repeated four times.

## methodology
Answer: Usability study with quantitative measurements (proportion of tasks completed, time, unnecessary actions, precision errors, failed actions) and qualitative observations (impressions, behaviors)
Source: A usability study conducted on subjects at three different levels of cognitive impairment... The following variables were measured... Their gestures, reactions, and comments were recorded during the course of the different tasks.

## care_type
Answer: Cognitive training and therapeutic activities
Source: The present work presents a TUI prototype in the form of a mobile robot controlled by physical paddles aiming at creating games for the elderly to train their cognitive abilities.

## robot_type
Answer: Mobile robot controlled by tangible paddles
Source: The prototype presented in this work consists of two major components: a mobile robot and a set of paddles as tangible mechanisms to communicate with it.

## robot_name
Answer: Tangibot
Source: We present Tangibot, a tangible-mediated robot aimed at enabling more intuitive and appealing interactions.

## design_goal
Answer: Enable intuitive and appealing interactions, foster socialization, train cognitive abilities, improve quality of life
Source: The proposal consists of a generic and versatile technological device that allows both the elderly and the game designers (therapists) to easily create a range of activities. It also enables natural interactions through tangible manipulations and has the potential to foster socialization and the training of cognitive abilities that can improve the elders' quality of life.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Movement commands (shift forward, stop, turn right, turn left) via tangible paddles
Source: Each figure contains an RFID tag and represents a movement command to the robot, i.e. shift forward (green triangle), stop (red square), turn right (yellow circle), and turn left (blue circle).

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Tangible paddles for intuitive interaction, extendable sticks for reduced mobility, multi-user support for socialization
Source: Each paddle consists of an extendable stick (maximum length 45 cm), which would enable users with reduced mobility to give commands to the robot from a distance... Also, the use of multiple paddles would allow therapists to design multiuser activities to foster socialization between the participants.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Complexity for severe cognitive impairment, confusion with paddle commands (e.g., direction changes)
Source: The subjects with severe cognitive issues were significantly less successful in completing the tasks than the ones with none or mild impairments... This occurred because, in some cases, they confused directions, and did not understand why, using the same paddle, the robot sometimes turned to their right when it was looking at them and sometimes to their left when it was facing in the opposite direction.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: None or mild cognitive impairment, ability to plan actions, discovery of alternative commands
Source: The subjects with none or mild cognitive impairments were able to complete most of the exercises presented to them... Another remarkable behavior observed was that during the task with all four paddles, 6 users (15%) discovered that they could stop the robot not only with the red-squared paddle, but also with those for turning, and then put aside the former, so that they would have to handle fewer paddles at once.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe cognitive impairment, inactivity, aimlessness, confusion with commands
Source: The subjects with severe cognitive issues were significantly less successful in completing the tasks than the ones with none or mild impairments... the main reason of incompletion was aimlessness... the more cognitive impairment the subjects had, the more cases appeared when they remained inactive in front of the robot not knowing how to proceed with the interaction.

## engagement
Answer: 62.5% showed clear manifestations of enjoyment (e.g., laughter, expressions of fun, reluctance to stop)
Source: 25 out of 40 users (62.5%) showed clear manifestations of enjoyment, although these were more frequent in users as they presented lower cognitive impairment. They either laughed or expressed directly they were enjoying the activity.

## acceptance
Answer: 80% reported liking the platform; 10% expressed contempt; higher acceptance among those with no/mild impairment
Source: After completing the task, they were asked directly about whether they had liked the platform, and 32 out of 40 (80%) answered affirmatively... 4 out of 40 (10%) expressed clear impressions of contempt and irritation during the task.

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Tangibot is usable and engaging for elderly with no/mild cognitive impairment; triggers positive emotional reactions even in severe cases; multi-user activities recommended
Source: A usability study conducted on subjects at three different levels of cognitive impairment (none, mild, and severe) reveals that it is usable and engaging for users with no or mild cognitive impairment, and even though it is less usable for persons with severe impairment, it triggers positive emotional reactions among them... These results suggest that, in order to design future cognitive games with this platform, a single user should handle at most two commands at once. Multi-user activities could be built in which two or more users had to collaborate to solve a problem by jointly controlling the robot.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size for severe impairment group, perceptual deficits not considered, potential for intergenerational activities
Source: There are some limitations in our study. On the one hand, the small proportion of repetitions completed by the users with severe cognitive impairment... On the other hand, as pointed out by Glisky, it is important to note that deficits in perception (visual, acoustic, etc.) have a significant impact on cognition... Many elderly participants told us their grandchildren would 'love' such a platform as well. For this reason we believe that intergenerational activities with Tangibot could be worth exploring in the future.

## testing_context
Answer: In-lab study on a rectangular table (130 × 60 cm) in a controlled environment
Source: The experiment was conducted on a 130 × 60 cm rectangular table (see Fig. 1). Each subject performed the three tasks individually seated at the center of the table.
