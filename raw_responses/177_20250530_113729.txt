## sample_size
Answer: 12 participants completed the study
Source: A total of 12 participants completed the study.

## country
Answer: Taiwan
Source: The study was conducted in a residential care facility in Taiwan.

## age
Answer: Average age was 77.25 (SD 6.7)
Source: The participants' average age was 77.25 (SD 6.7).

## gender
Answer: 75% male, 25% female
Source: There were more males (75%) than females (25%).

## demographic_background
Answer: 58.4% had no formal education, 75% spoke Taiwanese, 41.7% spoke Japanese, 83.3% used wheelchairs
Source: Over half received no formal education (58.4%). The majority of the participants spoke Taiwanese (75%) and about 41.7% could speak Japanese. The majority used wheelchairs (83.3%).

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Barthel index mean score was 45.42 (SD 28.08), indicating severe dependency on activities of daily living
Source: Their Barthel index mean score was 45.42 (SD 28.08), indicating that this group of participants were in the severe level of dependency on their activities of daily living.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Participants looked forward to interacting with Paro and were more willing to join activities
Source: The participants looked forward to interact with Paro and often asked the nursing staff about the time to meet with Paro, and they were more willingly to come out their own room to join the activity with Paro.

## application_context
Answer: Residential care facilities
Source: The robot-assisted therapy can be provided as a routine activity program and has the potential to improve social health of older adults in residential care facilities.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 30 minutes twice a week for 4 weeks
Source: Participants then received a group robot-assisted therapy using Paro, a seal-like robotic pet, for 30 minutes twice a week for 4 weeks.

## methodology
Answer: One-group pre- and posttest design
Source: This pilot study used a one-group pretest and posttest design.

## care_type
Answer: Robot-assisted therapy for social interaction and activity participation
Source: This pilot study used a one-group pre- and posttest design to evaluate the effect of a robot-assisted therapy for older adults.

## robot_type
Answer: Seal-like robotic pet
Source: Participants then received a group robot-assisted therapy using Paro, a seal-like robotic pet.

## robot_name
Answer: Paro
Source: Participants then received a group robot-assisted therapy using Paro, a seal-like robotic pet.

## design_goal
Answer: To improve psychological well-being and social interaction
Source: Robot therapy or robot-assisted therapy uses robots as a substitute for animals through human–animal interactions to improve psychological well-being.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Reacts to sounds and touching with body movements, baby seal calls, eyes close and open, and can understand Japanese
Source: Paro can react to sounds and touching with body movements, baby seal calls, eyes close and open, and the Paro used in the study especially can understand Japanese and can memorize her own name.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Improved communication and interaction skills, activity participation
Source: Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that participants' communication and interaction skills (z = −2.94, P = 0.003) and activity participation (z = −2.66, P = 0.008) were significantly improved after receiving 4-week robot-assisted therapy.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited interaction time due to group setting with one Paro
Source: One of the limitations in our study was the use of group setting with only one Paro during the activity, so the time for each participant interacting with Paro was limited due to the expensive cost of purchasing Paro.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Participants who spoke Japanese interacted more with Paro
Source: Five participants in our study could speak Japanese, so they often spoke Japanese when they interacted with Paro.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## engagement
Answer: Participants were more willing to join activities and talked about Paro with staff
Source: The participants looked forward to interact with Paro and often asked the nursing staff about the time to meet with Paro, and they were more willingly to come out their own room to join the activity with Paro. Talking about Paro also became a common topic between the participants and the nursing staff during conversation in daily life.

## acceptance
Answer: Paro was well accepted by participants
Source: In our study, Paro was well accepted by the participants.

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Robot-assisted therapy significantly improved communication, interaction skills, and activity participation
Source: Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that participants' communication and interaction skills (z = −2.94, P = 0.003) and activity participation (z = −2.66, P = 0.008) were significantly improved after receiving 4-week robot-assisted therapy.

## additional_info
Answer: Small sample size, lack of control group, potential Hawthorne effect
Source: There were some factors that may limit the generalizability of the results of this study. This study used a small convenience sample with a one-group pretest and posttest design. There is also the possibility of the Hawthorne effect occurring due to the fact that participants had awareness of participation in the study.

## testing_context
Answer: Activity room in a residential care facility
Source: The participants interacted with the Paro in a group setting in an activity room of the facility in the afternoon.
