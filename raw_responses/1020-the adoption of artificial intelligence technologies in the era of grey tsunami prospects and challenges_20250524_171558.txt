## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, caregivers, and managers of senior living facilities
Source: "this paper focuses on senior living facilities and retirement communities. Within these contexts, literature has paid the attention on the role of nursing in supporting elderly in using smart technologies [14], on the importance of the phase of diagnosis and treatment making [15]."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs include health, clinical, social, and daily routines services; expectations include wider life expectancy and wellbeing
Source: "senior living facilities offering health, clinical, social, daily routines services (Figure 1) should be able to differentiate themselves from competitors enabling end users to live a real and positive experience [4]."

## methodology
Answer: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
Source: "This model will be analysed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses and check the loading of each factor."

## care_type
Answer: Health, clinical, social, and daily routines services
Source: "senior living facilities offering health, clinical, social, daily routines services (Figure 1) should be able to differentiate themselves from competitors enabling end users to live a real and positive experience [4]."

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid robots (e.g., NAO, Zora)
Source: "the humanoid robot NAO (58 cm tall) interacts with seniors, speaking, singing, and dancing since it recognizes subjects and shapes [11]. Zora, another humanoid robot, has two speakers, several microphones, and a camera to scan and identify shapes and it is able of many things, from demonstrating gymnastic exercises to sing elderly's favorite songs [12]."

## robot_name
Answer: NAO, Zora

## design_goal
Answer: To investigate antecedents of elderly acceptance or rejection of AI robots
Source: "we aim to investigate what can be the antecedents that can have impact on either willingness or objection to use of AI robots."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Interaction, memory-training programs, rehabilitation, singing, dancing, gymnastic exercises
Source: "the humanoid robot NAO (58 cm tall) interacts with seniors, speaking, singing, and dancing since it recognizes subjects and shapes [11]. They are supportive for memory-training programs [11], for rehabilitation [12]."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Interaction, memory-training, rehabilitation, singing, dancing, gymnastic exercises

## acceptance
Answer: Explored through a revisited Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
Source: "this paper proposes a revisited Technology Acceptance Model. The model is analyzed using SEM to test the hypotheses and to check the loading of each factor."

## trust
Answer: Trust is a factor in the proposed model influencing emotions and willingness to use AI robots
Source: "Trust positively influences the generation of positive emotions toward the use of AI robots."

## key_findings
Answer: The proposed model overcomes gaps in existing acceptance models and considers new items related to elderly needs; social influence, hedonic motivation, and anthropomorphism impact acceptance or rejection
Source: "The results show important implications. From a theoretical point of view, the proposed model overcomes the current gaps of existing acceptance models and takes into consideration new items that are strictly related to the specific target of senior citizens and the related needs."

## additional_info
Answer: The study highlights managerial implications for senior living facilities and the trade-off costs-benefits in adopting AI technologies
Source: "From a managerial point of view, the paper deepens possible solutions as a response to the lack of available human resources, as well as how and to what extent robots can be exploited; also, the trade-off costsbenefits in adopting AI technologies and the possible options of usage for the customers are investigated."
