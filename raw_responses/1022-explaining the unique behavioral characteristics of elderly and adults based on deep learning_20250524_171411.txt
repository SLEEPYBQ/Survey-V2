Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## design_goal
Answer: To provide customized services for the elderly to counter aging society problems
Source: An analysis of the behavioral characteristics of the elderly and young adults based on their physical conditions enables silver robots to provide customized services for the elderly to counter aging society problems.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Behavioral recognition and context-awareness
Source: A customized behavioral recognizer can be designed based on the behavioral characteristics of the elderly, and it can provide important information for the context-awareness of silver robots.

## key_findings
Answer: The behavioral characteristics of the elderly and young adults were analyzed using deep learning and explainable AI, showing differences in movements such as head tilting and hand usage.
Source: The visualized results were compared between the data of young adults and the elderly to analyze the behavioral characteristics.

## additional_info
Answer: The study has limitations such as noise in certain behavioral data and dynamic movements making analysis difficult.
Source: However, in certain behavioral data, skeletons have excessive noise or movements are extremely dynamic, making the analysis of the characteristics difficult.

## testing_context
Answer: Residential apartment environment (living room, kitchen, bedroom)
Source: They performed 55 behaviors in their daily life in the living room, kitchen, and bedroom of the residential apartment environment.
