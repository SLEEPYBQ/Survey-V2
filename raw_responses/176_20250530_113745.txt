## country
Answer: Israel
Source: "Department of Industrial Engineering and Management and ABC Robotics Initiative, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel"

## age
Answer: 65–84 years (mean = 73.54, SD = 5.19)
Source: "Twenty-six older adults (17 females and 9 males) ages 65–84 (mean = 73.54, SD = 5.19) participated in the experiments."

## gender
Answer: 17 females, 9 males
Source: "Twenty-six older adults (17 females and 9 males) ages 65–84"

## demographic_background
Answer: 80% high independence in household chores, 30% bachelor's degree, 30% postgraduate degree, 40% high school or other education; all used technology regularly (smartphones and computers)
Source: "Eighty percent (21/26) indicated that they had high independence in performing household chores... Most of the participants had an academic degree: 30% (8/26) at bachelor's level and 30% (8/26) at the postgraduate level. The remainder (10/26) had high school or another level of education. All participants used technology regularly; they all had smartphones and computers."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Healthy individuals capable of basic physical activities; no specific cognitive impairments reported
Source: "All participants were healthy individuals who stated that they could perform basic physical activities such as standing and climbing stairs."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for physical and cognitive training to maintain independence and quality of life; preference for customizable and motivating robotic trainers
Source: "Physical and cognitive training can maintain and improve older adults' independence and quality of life... The findings highlight the importance of customizing the system to the needs of different users and the role of meaningful feedback."

## application_context
Answer: Home environments or senior centers for long-term independent use
Source: "Experiments with 26 older adults (65–84 years of age) were performed in home environments... The system was designed to be compact, robust, easy to use and enable long-term independent operation by older adults in their homes."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Two training sessions (one physical, one combined physical and cognitive), each with random exercise selection; session duration not specified
Source: "Each participant underwent two training sessions: one included only physical training, and the other included both physical and cognitive training. The order of the sessions was randomized."

## methodology
Answer: Within-subjects experimental design with qualitative and quantitative measures (questionnaires, success rate tracking)
Source: "We employed a 'within subjects' experimental design in which the dependent variables were subjective measures related to the acceptance of the training, as assessed by means of questionnaires."

## care_type
Answer: Physical and cognitive training
Source: "This study suggests that social robots can satisfy this demand and presents the development of 'Gymmy', a robotic system for the physical and cognitive training of older adults."

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid mechanical-looking robot (Poppy Torso)
Source: "The system design includes a humanoid mechanical-looking robot (Poppy Torso) to demonstrate exercises"

## robot_name
Answer: Gymmy
Source: "the development of 'Gymmy', a robotic system for the physical and cognitive training of older adults."

## design_goal
Answer: Compact, robust, easy-to-use system for long-term independent operation; customizable to user needs; meaningful feedback
Source: "The system was designed to be compact, robust, easy to use and enable long-term independent operation by older adults in their homes... The findings highlight the importance of customizing the system to the needs of different users and the role of meaningful feedback."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Demonstrates exercises, provides instructions and feedback (visual and auditory), monitors performance via RGB-D camera, includes cognitive training games
Source: "a humanoid mechanical-looking robot (Poppy Torso) to demonstrate exercises, an RGB-D (depth) camera to monitor the user's performance... a touch screen and speakers to provide instructions and feedback."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Positive feedback for correct movements, clear instructions, customizable exercises, cognitive training integration
Source: "When the user performs the movement correctly, the robot signals a correct repetition with verbal feedback and delivers a positive comment (such as 'well done') after eight successful repetitions."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Insertion of cognitive training in the middle of physical training was confusing for some users
Source: "Another issue that was raised by the participants was that the insertion of cognitive training in the middle of the physical training was problematic and confusing."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher education, positive attitude toward robots, higher success rate in exercises
Source: "people with postgraduate degrees rated it higher... higher levels of success resulted in higher attitude ratings"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Negative attitude toward robots, lower education levels
Source: "a higher level of NARS-S1 (implying greater negativity) resulted in lower ratings of perceived usefulness"

## engagement
Answer: 80.77% reported high engagement (mean Likert score = 4.212, SD = 0.874)
Source: "Most participants (80.77%) gave high ratings of engagement with the robotic physical trainer (mean Likert score = 4.212, SD = 0.874)."

## acceptance
Answer: 46.15% perceived the robot as highly useful; 46.15% indicated intention to use it in the future
Source: "A substantial proportion of the participants (46.15%) perceived the robotic physical training system as highly useful... About half of the participants (46.15%) indicated a clear (i.e., rating of 4 or 5) intention to use the robotic system in the future"

## trust
Answer: 65.38% expressed trust in the trainer (mean Likert score = 3.865, SD = 0.975)
Source: "the majority (65.38%) expressed trust in the trainer (mean Likert score = 3.865, SD = 0.975)."

## key_findings
Answer: Age, attitude, and education influenced acceptance; success rate in exercises positively correlated with perceived usefulness and attitude; system was robust and reliable
Source: "The results showed that age, attitude and education influenced the acceptance of the robotic system... The system was proven to be robust and reliable, demonstrating clear potential to be used as a personal trainer and as a means of motivating older adults."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include only upper-body exercises, no oldest-old participants, small sample size
Source: "The limitations of this work include the fact that only upper-body exercises were included in the system... This study is also limited by the absence of participants in the oldest-old group and by the sample size."

## testing_context
Answer: Home environments or senior centers
Source: "Due to COVID-19, older adults were understandably reluctant to come to the university to participate in the experiments. Therefore, the sessions took place in their own homes or at senior centers located in their vicinity."
