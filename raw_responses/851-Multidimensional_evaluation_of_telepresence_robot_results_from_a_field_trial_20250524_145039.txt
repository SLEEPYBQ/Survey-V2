Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided research paper:

## Involved Stakeholder
Elderly people, formal caregivers (social workers), and technical solution providers (engineers).

Source: "10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot... through which the formal caregiver could remotely visit and chat with them." "The recruitment process was conducted by Pane & Rose social cooperative... the engineers trained the social workers to the use of the Double robot."

## Sample Size
10 elderly participants (8 for expectation questionnaire analysis as 2 didn't complete it).

Source: "a total of ten older adults accepted to be involved in the field trial" "Two subjects did not answer to expectation questionnaire at T0 and TF. Therefore, only the comparative analysis was conducted on 8 subjects"

## Country
Italy (Prato municipality, Tuscany region)

Source: "Pane & Rose social cooperative, which was involved in the CloudIA project, founded by Tuscany Region" "operating in the municipality of Prato"

## Age
Mean age 75.10 ± 16.48 years (range not specified)

Source: "a total of ten older adults accepted to be involved in the field trial (aged: 75.10 ± 16.48 years old)"

## Gender
4 male, 6 female participants

Source: "Four of them were male, and six participants were female."

## Demographic Background
- Marital status: 1 married, 5 widowed, 4 not married
- Living situation: 2 lived alone, 8 lived with relatives
- Education: 5 elementary school, 4 middle school, 1 higher education
- All were beneficiaries of home assistant care

Source: "One person was married, five persons were widowed, and the remaining were not married. Two persons lived alone, and the others lived with relatives. As concerns the educational level, five persons attended the elementary school, four persons the middle school, and the remaining had a higher educational level. Before starting the trial, all the participants signed an informed consent form."

## Cognitive And Physical Impairment
Described as "frail elderly" but no specific cognitive/physical impairment measures reported.

Source: "10 frail elderly were asked to live with a telepresence robot"

## Needs And Expectations
Needs: Support for independent living, social connection, safety/emergency support
Expectations: Privacy concerns, fear of robot, communication difficulties, potential for increased independence and security

Source: "the social rationale behind this choice came from... a strong need to support the social workers and improve the socialization and the monitoring of people" "expectation item 1 (Privacy Concern), Item 3 (Afraid to not good at use), Item 8 (increased distance) such as Item 12 (negative for the relationship respectively)"

## Application Context
Home-based telepresence service for elderly to support independent living and social connection with caregivers.

Source: "a robotic telepresence service could support the frail persons in their homes, empowering their social relationships"

## Process Of The Care
Long-term deployment (average 16.9 days per participant), with caregivers calling during fixed time slots. Total 169 days of testing, 105 telepresence sessions averaging 29 minutes each.

Source: "a total of 169 days of field-test trial" "105 telepresence services were delivered. The average duration of a single service was equal to 29 mins" "the caregiver fixed a time slot during which he/she could call the participant"

## Methodology
Mixed-methods: Quantitative questionnaires (Likert-scale) administered before (T0) and after (TF) field trial, with correlation and non-parametric statistical analysis.

Source: "two multidimensional questionnaires were administrated at the beginning (T0) and ad the end (TF) of the field test" "Non-parametric tests were applied to compare different conditions and users"

## Care Type
Social care and remote monitoring through telepresence.

Source: "the proposed telepresence service is a potential solution to improve both the quality of elders' life and the services provided to them"

## Robot Type
Telepresence robot (wheeled mobile base with tablet interface)

Source: "The Double robot is mainly composed of three parts: the robot, the iPad (Apple, California), and the charging station. It is a self-driving, two-wheeled telepresence robot which mounts an iPad."

## Robot Name
Double Robot

Source: "the Double robot" "Double Robotics (Burlingame, California)"

## Design Goal
To provide remote support for frail elderly, improve socialization and monitoring, support independent living.

Source: "The social rationale behind this choice came from... a strong need to support the social workers and improve the socialization and the monitoring of people included in the domiciliary assistive program."

## Robot Concern Function
Telepresence for remote visits and chatting with caregivers, autonomous navigation to charging station.

Source: "through which the formal caregiver could remotely visit and chat with them" "the caregiver could use it to move into the environment and interacting with the user in his home"

## Facilitating Functions
- Easy installation (plug-and-play)
- Autonomous return to charging station
- Remote mobility for caregivers
- Positive impact on perceived independence and security

Source: "the installation of the double robot in the home is very plug and play" "Before finish the call, the caregiver send it back at the charging station" "subjects who considered that the robot would permit the caregiver to be more present and close to themselves"

## Inhibitory Functions
- Initial privacy concerns
- Fear of robot
- Perceived communication difficulties
- Concerns about reduced caregiver presence

Source: "expectation item 1 (Privacy Concern), Item 2 (be afraid of the robot), Item 7 (difficult in the communication), Item 8 (increased distance)"

## Stakeholder Facilitating Characteristics
- Positive initial expectations
- Higher education level (trend)
- Openness to technology
- Enjoyment during use

Source: "subjects who had a higher overall expectation... showed a higher level of trust" "highest enjoyment scores (ENJ-Q6) at TF are related to the perception of the robot as an intelligent and safe agent"

## Stakeholder Inhibitory Characteristics
- Negative initial expectations
- Anxiety about technology
- Privacy concerns
- Lower education level (trend)

Source: "subjects who expected the robot negatively affects their privacy... felt also more embarrassed and nervous using the robot"

## Engagement
Positive engagement trend observed, with increased enjoyment scores after use (ENJ-Q6).

Source: "the ENJ-Q6 reports a positive trend after the use" "After using the robot, people declare to enjoy more than they expected"

## Acceptance
Overall acceptance score increased from 61.17 (T0) to 70.83 (TF) on 0-100 scale.

Source: "The mean overall score for the ad-hoc questionnaires... was 61.17 (SD=12.30) at T0 and 70.83 (SD=9.79) at TF"

## Trust
Positive trend in trust scores (TRUST-Q7) after use, correlated with initial positive expectations.

Source: "the TRUST subscale shows an interesting pattern... making real experience with the robot could foster the trust"

## Key Findings
1. Expectations influence both perceived and actual robot usability/acceptance
2. Real experience improves trust and reduces fear
3. Positive initial expectations correlate with better outcomes
4. No demographic factors significantly influenced results
5. Multidimensional evaluation is crucial for understanding robot adoption

Source: "Results remark that expectation could influence the potential and the real use of the robot" "the use of the robot itself could improve some parameters" "a positive a priori attitude is related to more trust towards the robot"

## Additional Info
Limitations: Small sample size (n=10), short duration (average 16.9 days per participant), no control group. Future work suggested to include training sessions to improve expectations.

Source: "Based on our small sample" "As a robot's designer and developer, we need to meet the subjects' needs and personality traits fostering trust" "seminars and training sessions on robots should be organized to enhance user expectations"

## Testing Context
Private homes of elderly participants (real-world setting)

Source: "tested in real houses" "the other two (i.e. training in situ and field test) took place at the user's private home"
