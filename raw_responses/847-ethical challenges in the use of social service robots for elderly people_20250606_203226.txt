## key_findings  
Answer: Ethical challenges in robotics include privacy, data protection, safety, isolation, loss of autonomy, overstressing users, and deception. Ethical guidelines are essential for deployment and research in social service robots.  
Source: "The main areas where ethical reflection is decisive are: privacy, data protection, safety and also the question whether the functionalities of a robot might not tend to lead to isolation, loss of autonomy, overstressing of users and/or deception."  

## additional_info  
Answer: The paper discusses ethical guidelines for deploying robots, including informed consent, privacy, safety, and addressing vulnerability. It emphasizes the need for continuous ethical reflection and involvement of end users and caregivers.  
Source: "Ethics can lead to changes or obstacles in both scientific and practical deployments. Ethics, however, should not be treated as slowing down research and technical possibilities. Instead, ethics should be incorporated in order to develop more helpful devices for older people."
