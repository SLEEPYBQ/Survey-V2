Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided research paper:

## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Care home residents, care staff, family members, and researchers  
Source: "Collaborating care staff in all homes were encouraged to record observations on their calendars... We also conducted qualitative semistructured interviews with care staff at 8 months"

## sample_size
Answer: 253 residents had robot interaction opportunities, 83 were consented for direct data collection (61 females, 22 males), 63 included in final analysis  
Source: "In total, 253 residents had robot interaction opportunities, and 83 were consented for direct data collection... leaving 63 participants for analysis (49 females and 14 males)"

## country
Answer: United Kingdom (specifically Cornwall)  
Source: "We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial in 8 care homes in Cornwall, United Kingdom"

## age
Answer: Mean age 87.21 years (SD 7.42)  
Source: "The average age of consented participants was 87.21 years (SD 7.42 years)"

## gender
Answer: 61 females, 22 males in consented participants; 49 females, 14 males in final analysis  
Source: "The 83 care home residents recruited for directly collected data comprised 61 females and 22 males... leaving 63 participants for analysis (49 females and 14 males)"

## demographic_background
Answer: Care home residents with varying dementia severity (mild to severe), living in residential or nursing care homes  
Source: "To allow stratified randomization, staff assessed consenting residents using the Dementia Severity Rating Scale... with 0-18 indicating mild dementia, 19-36 indicating moderate dementia, and 37-54 indicating severe dementia"

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Dementia severity scores ranged from 0-54 (mean 32.11, SD 10.52); communication challenges, challenging behavior  
Source: "The average dementia score was 32.11 (SD 10.52)... residents who did interact were considered to be at the higher end of moderate dementia (19-36)"

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Entertainment, anxiety reduction, agitation reduction, companionship, meaningful activity  
Source: "The main reasons recorded in the 'reason for use' of robots were entertainment, anxiety, and agitation"

## application_context
Answer: Care homes for older adults, particularly during COVID-19 pandemic  
Source: "This study was conducted in 8 care homes in Cornwall, United Kingdom... demonstrated the important value of the individual use of robot pets during the COVID-19 pandemic"

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 8-month study (4-month RCT + 4-month qualitative study), with variable interaction times (15 minutes to 24 hours)  
Source: "The study... comprised a 4-month, parallel, stratified, cluster RCT... followed by a qualitative study over an additional 4 months"

## methodology
Answer: Stratified cluster randomized controlled trial and mixed methods study (quantitative scales + qualitative interviews/observations)  
Source: "Stratified Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial and Mixed Methods Study"

## care_type
Answer: Psychosocial care for dementia symptoms, occupational disruptiveness reduction  
Source: "Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia, including reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness"

## robot_type
Answer: Animal-like (Joy for All cats and dogs)  
Source: "In mid-January 2020, homes in the intervention group were gifted a JfA cat and dog"

## robot_name
Answer: Joy for All (JfA) cats and dogs  
Source: "recent studies have suggested the good acceptability and implementation feasibility of more affordable devices (Joy for All [JfA] cats and dogs)"

## design_goal
Answer: Affordable alternative to Paro, psychosocial support, well-being improvement  
Source: "We aimed to address the limited effectiveness research on JfA devices... Robot pets may assist in the challenges of supporting an aging population with growing dementia prevalence"

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Respond to touch, make sounds, simulate breathing/heartbeat  
Source: "Stakeholders commented on hygiene as a design limitation... supported the importance of realistic design, life-simulation features, and interactivity"

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Calming effect, companionship, meaningful activity, reduced anxiety/agitation  
Source: "The pets aided in reducing loneliness and providing company and comfort... qualitative accounts also supporting reductions in agitation"

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Hygiene concerns, breakage issues, some residents disliked them  
Source: "Stakeholders commented on hygiene as a design limitation... there were some incidences of negative responses, such as jealousy and over-attachment"

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher dementia severity, loneliness, social isolation  
Source: "residents who interacted with robots had significantly higher dementia severity scores... subjective loneliness may be a predictive factor in the acceptance and benefit of robot pets"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Mild dementia, socially engaged residents  
Source: "residents who were disinterested in the robots were more socially engaged, preferring to play games and socialize with other people"

## engagement
Answer: 85% positive experiences among interacting residents, average interaction length 3.9 hours  
Source: "Among the residents reported to interact with the robots (54/81), 85% (46/54) were reported to have positive experiences... with an average interaction length of 3.9 hours"

## acceptance
Answer: 74% of analyzed residents interacted with robots, good adoption into care home routines  
Source: "74% of residents included in the analysis interacted with the robots... Our results demonstrate that robots had high levels of use, and were clearly well adopted into daily practice"

## trust
Answer: No novelty effect observed over 8 months, sustained use  
Source: "the study demonstrated no novelty effect for devices over 8 months, providing evidence against novelty as a concern for robot pet research"

## key_findings
Answer: Reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms, no novelty effect, more effective for residents with moderate/severe dementia, valuable during COVID-19 isolation  
Source: "Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia, including reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness"

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include inability to blind collaborators, COVID-19 impact on study design  
Source: "A third methodological limitation results from the inability to blind collaborators to conditions... the COVID-19 pandemic, resultant care home lock downs, staff workloads, and resident deaths meant that we were unable to carry out the RCT as originally planned"

## testing_context
Answer: 8 care homes (4 nursing, 4 residential) in Cornwall, UK  
Source: "We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial in 8 care homes in Cornwall, United Kingdom... comprising 4 care homes with nursing care and 4 residential-only care homes"
