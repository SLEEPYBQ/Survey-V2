## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Participants expressed that robots could be useful in a care home to control lights or the TV but not for conversation; some expected robots to help with chores or cleaning; several thought Furhat could be harmful or confusing for people with dementia.
Source: "Some other participants expressed that the robot could be useful in a care home to control lights or the TV but not for conversation. It was even raised by several people that Furhat could potentially be harmful for people with dementia. The reason for this was that Furhat is 'only' a head on a table which could be confusing or even scary for people that might not be able to interpret what Furhat is." and "For example, many of the participants asked the robot if it could clean or help with chores, but since it is mainly conversation based, they perhaps formed a mental model that robots in general cannot help them."

## application_context
Answer: Care homes for older adults
Source: "With more robots entering our social environment, for example in care homes, it is important to determine the potential end users' perception of different platforms to judge their usefulness."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: First encounter, short-term use; each session lasted roughly 10 minutes
Source: "We conducted a short-term interaction study..." and "After roughly 10 minutes of conversation, the robot said goodbye and the participant was asked to return to the other room and fill in the GODSPEED and NARS questionnaire."

## methodology
Answer: Short-term interaction study using Wizard of Oz method, followed by quantitative surveys (GODSPEED and NARS questionnaires)
Source: "We conducted a short-term interaction study with the Furhat robot." and "Social acceptance toward the Furhat was investigated using the GODSPEED questionnaire, and NARS was used to measure general negative attitudes toward robots..."

## care_type
Answer: Social/companionship care (focus on conversation and social acceptance)
Source: "Furhat, a blended embodiment of a physical robot head with a virtual (backprojected) face, is being marketed as one of the most social robots with high human-likeness." and "The session started when the participant entered the room with the robot and sat down on a chair in front of the robot table..."

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid robot head with a virtual (backprojected) face (blended embodiment)
Source: "Furhat, a blended embodiment of a physical robot head with a virtual (backprojected) face..."

## robot_name
Answer: Furhat
Source: "We conducted a short-term interaction study with the Furhat robot."

## design_goal
Answer: To create a friendly and curious robot with a human-like face and voice, aiming for social interaction and conversation with older adults
Source: "The personality of the robot was friendly and curious, with the robot saying polite words (e.g., 'thank you' and 'please') as well as the robot initiating questions and stating that it wanted to learn more from the participants. We chose these personality traits since they have been mentioned as important by older adults in previous work [12]."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Conversation-based interaction; introduction, discussing the role of robots in society, how robots could help in care homes, and saying goodbye; gaze control and gestures
Source: "For the study session, the wizard had prepared a few topics that the conversation with the participant could evolve around. These were: introduction of the robot and the participant, which role robots should have in society, how robots could help in care homes, and finally ending the conversation and saying goodbye. ... functions such as typing sentences, gaze control and gestures were used."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Friendly and curious personality, polite language, ability to initiate questions, natural head movement, gaze control, gestures
Source: "The personality of the robot was friendly and curious, with the robot saying polite words (e.g., 'thank you' and 'please') as well as the robot initiating questions and stating that it wanted to learn more from the participants." and "The robot can turn its head with a human-like neck design, which creates a natural head movement, both up and down, and to the sides."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Lack of a human-like body (only a head), limited to conversation (cannot help with chores), appearance potentially confusing or scary for people with dementia
Source: "Furhat is 'only' a head on a table which could be confusing or even scary for people that might not be able to interpret what Furhat is." and "since it is mainly conversation based, they perhaps formed a mental model that robots in general cannot help them."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Willingness to engage in conversation, openness to new experiences
Source: "However, despite the negative comments and survey results, all participants were engaged in the interaction. All talked to the robot, answered its questions, and many asked their own."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Pre-existing negative attitudes toward robots, reluctance to interact with robots, discomfort with being alone with the robot, skepticism about robot usefulness
Source: "Some older adults expressed that they did not want anything to do with a robot, some declined participation after seeing the robot, and some did not want to interact with the robot alone. ... some of the older adults that wanted to participate, declared before the study that they did not approve of robots and that their motivation for participation was to convey these opinions."

## engagement
Answer: All participants were engaged in the interaction; all talked to the robot, answered its questions, and many asked their own
Source: "However, despite the negative comments and survey results, all participants were engaged in the interaction. All talked to the robot, answered its questions, and many asked their own."

## acceptance
Answer: Low social acceptance for Furhat among older adults (GODSPEED mean = 2.68, SD = 0.73)
Source: "The results indicates that older adults have a negative attitude towards robots after meeting the Furhat robot (mean = 2.98, SD = 0.68), and especially towards robot emotions (mean = 3.63, SD = 0.96). They further indicate that older adults do not perceive the robots as alive (mean = 2.19, SD = 0.73) or human-like (mean = 2.00, SD = 0.70)." and "GODSPEED ... 2.68, SD = 0.73"

## trust
Answer: Participants believed the robot to be safe to be around (perceived safety mean = 3.58, SD = 1.07)
Source: "However, they do believe the robot to be safe to be around (mean = 3.58, SD = 1.07)."

## key_findings
Answer: Older adults had low social acceptance and a negative attitude toward Furhat, especially regarding robot emotions; Furhat was perceived as machine-like and not anthropomorphic or sentient; all participants were engaged in the interaction despite negative attitudes.
Source: "The results indicate that older adults found Furhat to be machine-like and that they had a negative attitude toward robots, and especially in emotional contexts." and "Despite these scores, all participants were engaged in the interaction with the robot."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, difficulty recruiting participants, variability in Furhat's appearance and voice, and inconsistency in reporting GODSPEED and NARS results; NARS measures general attitude, not robot-specific attitude.
Source: "One limitation with the study is the large variety of face masks, textures, and voices available for the Furhat, which makes it difficult to compare different Furhat studies with each other in cases where the setup of the robot is different. ... Another limitation with the study is the inconsistency of reporting results for the GODSPEED and NARS questionnaires. ... Due to the small sample size, future studies need to confirm the results with a larger group of participants."

## testing_context
Answer: Senior centre in Linköping, Sweden; participants sat in a room with the robot on a table
Source: "The study was conducted at a senior centre in Linköping..." and "The session started when the participant entered the room with the robot and sat down on a chair in front of the robot table (see Figure [3])."
