## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Seniors with Alzheimer's disease, caregivers, university students (speakers and observers)
Source: "Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study." "We recruited five university students who major in gerontology as evaluators."

## sample_size
Answer: 3 elderly participants, 5 university students
Source: "Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study." "We recruited five university students who major in gerontology as evaluators."

## country
Answer: Japan
Source: "The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months in a group home for seniors with dementia in Osaka, Japan."

## age
Answer: 85-96 years old
Source: "Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study."

## gender
Answer: Female
Source: "Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study."

## demographic_background
Answer: Seniors with Alzheimer's disease living in a group home; university students majoring in gerontology

## technology_literacy
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Cognitive: Alzheimer's disease (moderate to severe dementia); Physical: Not explicitly mentioned
Source: "They were all clinically diagnosed as AD." "Her MMSE score was 0, indicating severe dementia."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs: Communication support, motivation to interact; Expectations: Positive emotional reactions, improved communication
Source: "We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors." "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## application_context
Answer: Elderly care facilities, long-term communication support
Source: "We discuss the possibilities of using Telenoid as a tool to support long-term communication between people and elderly individuals."

## testing_context
Answer: Group home for seniors with dementia
Source: "The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months in a group home for seniors with dementia in Osaka, Japan."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 10 trials per participant, 15-minute sessions, once or twice a week for 3 months
Source: "We conducted 10 trials (interactions) for each participant." "The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months."

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, video analysis, questionnaires
Source: "From the video recordings, we counted the number of times that the participants used body gestures and made physical contact." "The speaker and the observer answered questionnaires."

## robot_type
Answer: Teleoperated robot with child-like appearance
Source: "Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice."

## robot_name
Answer: Telenoid R3b
Source: "Telenoid R3b (Figure 1)."

## design_goal
Answer: To provide communication support for seniors, motivate interaction
Source: "We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors."

## robot_general_function
Answer: Transmit remote operator's movements and voice, enable physical interaction (hugging, touching)
Source: "Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Physical interaction (hugging, touching), child-like appearance, remote operation
Source: "Telenoid users can physically interact (hug and touch) with the robot while communicating with an operator."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited non-verbal communication, difficulty in understanding severe dementia patients
Source: "Non-verbal information, like holding hands and eye contact, is important, but communicating this through Telenoid was difficult."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Positive reaction to child-like appearance, less nervousness
Source: "They treated Telenoid as a child, which is huggable and easier to touch."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe dementia, difficulty in verbal communication
Source: "Ms. C had severe AD, and it was difficult to verbally communicate with her."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement with Telenoid, positive emotional reactions
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance of Telenoid, especially by moderate AD patients
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## robot_function_effectiveness
Answer: Effective in motivating interaction, less effective for severe AD
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## user_satisfaction
Answer: High satisfaction with Telenoid, especially in moderate AD patients
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## learning_curve_productivity
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## system_controllability_interaction
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Telenoid motivated interaction in moderate AD patients, less effective for severe AD
Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include lack of comparison with other robots, need for caregiver support
Source: "The experiment did not prove the effect of Telenoid itself, since the speakers had conversations both with Telenoid and face-to-face."
