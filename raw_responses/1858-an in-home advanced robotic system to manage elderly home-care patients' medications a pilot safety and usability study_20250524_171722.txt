================================================================================

## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly home-care patients, nurses, and technical advisors
Source: The 17 nursing home patients had 457 total days using the device (Phase I; mean, 26.9 per patient). Phase II involved home-care patients from 3 sites (n ¼ 27) who were on long-term medication. Patients' and nurses' experiences were assessed with structured interviews.

## sample_size
Answer: Phase I: 17 nursing home patients; Phase II: 27 home-care patients
Source: Phase I (n ¼ 17) was conducted to verify that there were no robotic malfunctions that would hinder the device's unsupervised, safe use in patient's homes. Phase II studied the device in the less-controlled setting of the patient's home (n ¼ 27).

## country
Answer: Finland
Source: This pilot study was conducted in Finland, where the advanced robotic device and telecare system for managing medications of home-care persons on long-term pharmacotherapy was developed.

## age
Answer: Phase I: mean age 73.0 years; Phase II: mean age 75.3 years
Source: Patients in Phase I were predominantly men (65%), but most Phase II patients were women (59%). Ages were similar for each phase (73.0 versus 75.3 years).

## gender
Answer: Phase I: 65% men; Phase II: 59% women
Source: Patients in Phase I were predominantly men (65%), but most Phase II patients were women (59%).

## demographic_background
Answer: Most Phase II patients (78%) lived alone at home, and 52% required 2-3 home-care visits per week to daily.
Source: Most Phase II patients (78%) lived alone at home, and 52% of them required from 2 to 3 HC visits per week to at least once daily, with 22% of them requiring at least one daily visit.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: 3 subjects had early-stage dementia, and 2 other subjects were diagnosed with schizophrenia.
Source: Mild cognitive impairments did not preclude participation; 3 subjects had early-stage dementia, and 2 other subjects were diagnosed with schizophrenia.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Patients needed assistance with medication adherence and reported difficulty remembering to take medicines (23% in Phase II). Nurses needed reliable and easy-to-use technology.
Source: At baseline, Phase II home-dwelling patients reported difficulty remembering to take their medicines (23%), and 18% missed at least 2 doses per week. All patients and 96% of nurses reported the device was easy to use.

## application_context
Answer: In-home medication management for elderly home-care patients
Source: We examined the safety profile and usability of an integrated advanced robotic device and telecare system to promote medication adherence for elderly home-care patients.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Phase I: 26.9 mean days per patient; Phase II: 26.9 mean days per patient
Source: The 17 nursing home patients had 457 total days using the device (Phase I; mean, 26.9 per patient). The device was used for 727 days by 27 patients (mean, 26.9 days per patient).

## methodology
Answer: Two-phase prospective usability study with structured interviews
Source: This two-phase prospective usability study was performed in Espoo, a part of Finland's capitol area, in 2013 to 2014. Patients' and nurses' experiences were assessed with structured interviews.

## care_type
Answer: Medication management for elderly home-care patients
Source: We examined the safety profile and usability of an integrated advanced robotic device and telecare system to promote medication adherence for elderly home-care patients.

## robot_type
Answer: Advanced robotic device (Evondos E300) with telecare system
Source: This brief report concerns a safety profile and usability trial of an advanced robotic device and telecare system (Evondos E300 and Evondos Telecare System, Salo, Finland).

## robot_name
Answer: Evondos E300
Source: This brief report concerns a safety profile and usability trial of an advanced robotic device and telecare system (Evondos E300 and Evondos Telecare System, Salo, Finland).

## design_goal
Answer: To improve medication adherence, support individualized dosing schedules, and enable patient-provider communications
Source: It supports individualized patient dosing schedules, patient–provider communications, and on-time, in-home medication delivery to promote adherence.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Dispensing medicine sachets, providing reminders, and communicating missed doses to providers
Source: The device delivered and patients retrieved medicine sachets for 99% of the alerts. If a patient misses a sachet, the telecare system passes that information to the HC unit for action.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Reliable medication dispensing (99.3% success rate), reminders (audio, visual, and written), and real-time monitoring
Source: The device's dispenser button was pressed successfully 99.3% of the time (2075 presses/2090 alerts). A spoken reminder message, a sound signal, a light signal in the dose button, and written instructions on the device's display are activated at individually predetermined dosing times.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Technical malfunctions (0.72% failure rate), fear of technology (one patient withdrew)
Source: Failure to deliver the medicines sachet declined by 63% from Phase I to Phase II (1.97% to 0.72%). One participant withdrew because of fear of technology.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Motivation to adhere to medication, living alone (78% in Phase II)
Source: Most Phase II patients (78%) lived alone at home. Patients were selected by nurses based on their assessment that the potential participant was motivated to take their medicines.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Lack of trust (one patient withdrew), fear of technology (one patient withdrew)
Source: One participant discontinued because of lack of trust, and another withdrew because of fear of technology.

## engagement
Answer: High engagement with 99.3% successful button presses and 98.7% on-time retrievals
Source: The device's dispenser button was pressed successfully 99.3% of the time (2075 presses/2090 alerts), and 98.7% of the alerts resulted in on-time medicine sachet retrievals by the patients.

## acceptance
Answer: 89% of patients and 88% of nurses would recommend the device
Source: In Phase II, 89% of patients and 88% of nurses would recommend or probably recommend this device for further use.

## trust
Answer: One patient withdrew due to lack of trust, but overall high trust was reported
Source: One participant discontinued because of lack of trust. All but one of the Phase II patients reported that the device functioned reliably.

## key_findings
Answer: The device demonstrated safety, usability, and high adherence rates (97.7% in Phase I, 98.7% in Phase II). Patients and nurses reported high satisfaction.
Source: This trial demonstrated the safety profile and usability of an in-home advanced robotic device and telecare system and its acceptability to patients and nurses. On-time sachet retrieval occurred with 97.7% of the alerts, and no medication doses were missed.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, short duration, and no direct observation of medicine consumption.
Source: This pilot clinical safety and usability study has limitations: (1) small sample size, (2) short duration, (3) no direct observation of medicine consumption.

## testing_context
Answer: Phase I: nursing home; Phase II: patients' homes
Source: Phase I was conducted under the controlled conditions of a single nursing home. Phase II studied the device in the less-controlled setting of the patient's home.
