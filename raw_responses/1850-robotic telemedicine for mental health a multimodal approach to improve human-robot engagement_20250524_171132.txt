## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, people with dementia (PwD), caregivers, clinicians, robotics researchers
Source: "The robot has been modified to enable clinical telemedicine for cognitive engagement with older adults and people with dementia (PwD) in LMICs."

## sample_size
Answer: 15 healthy participants for emotion recognition, 10 for user experience experiments, 14 PwD and 26 healthy older adults in India
Source: "Experiments with healthy participants demonstrate emotion recognition exceeding 90% for happy, tired, sad, angry, surprised and stern/disgusted robotic emotions."

## country
Answer: United Kingdom and India
Source: "Experiments with healthy participants in the United Kingdom demonstrating the robot's ability to adapt facial expressions to users' speech in real-time and a qualitative user experience analysis indicates overall enthusiastic and engaging reception to human-robot multimodal interaction with the new framework."

## age
Answer: 23–49 years for healthy participants, 67 years for PwD participant
Source: "Experiments with N = 15 healthy participants (23–49 years, 3 female, 12 male) in the United Kingdom to qualitatively assess the optimized design."

## gender
Answer: 3 female, 12 male for healthy participants; gender not specified for PwD
Source: "Experiments with N = 15 healthy participants (23–49 years, 3 female, 12 male) in the United Kingdom."

## demographic_background
Answer: Not explicitly stated
Source: Not found in the paper

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Participants with vascular dementia, CDR rating 1 (mild)
Source: "vascular dementia diagnosis, CDR rating 1 (mild) ([Morris, 1991])."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for mental health support, companionship, and reduced caregiver burden
Source: "The need for mental health and psychosocial support of PwD and their carers worldwide is well-documented."

## application_context
Answer: Telemedicine for mental health and dementia support
Source: "The robot has been modified to enable clinical telemedicine for cognitive engagement with older adults and people with dementia (PwD) in LMICs."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Three repeated sessions of 30 minutes each
Source: "three repeated sessions of remote cognitive engagement using the hybrid face robot, of 30 min each, were conducted with a person with dementia."

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys, emotion recognition tasks, user experience experiments
Source: "We conducted a series of emotion recognition tasks with a total of N = 14 PwD and N = 26 healthy older adults to assess cultural appropriateness and recognition of robotic facial expressions in South India."

## care_type
Answer: Mental health and dementia care
Source: "Robotic Telemedicine for Mental Health: A Multimodal Approach to Improve Human-Robot Engagement."

## robot_type
Answer: Hybrid face robot combining digital facial expressions with a 3D printed faceplate
Source: "The hybrid face robot integrates a digital face capable of showing facial expressions and a 3D printed faceplate to convey realism and depth."

## robot_name
Answer: Not explicitly named
Source: Not found in the paper

## design_goal
Answer: To create a low-cost, culturally appropriate robotic platform for telemedicine
Source: "The goal of this investigation is to design, develop, and test the feasibility of a social robotic platform to support people with dementia, during and following the COVID-19 pandemic."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Facial expressions, speech, and autonomous conversation capabilities
Source: "The robot's software design is based on a mathematical approach for emotion mapping, in which the robot's expression state, e →(t), for any given time, t, is defined as the weighted linear combination of a set of basis expressions."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Facial expressions and speech integration enhance engagement
Source: "The integration of affective communicative modalities and implementation in social robots can ultimately lead to improved engagement in HRI in demanding healthcare contexts."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Technical issues like network lags and voice distortion
Source: "We identified lags and distortion of voice during remote clinical sessions as the main technical issue to solve for next trials."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Familiarity with interactive technologies, cultural appropriateness
Source: "Cultural differences—which influence compliance—as well as technical challenges and cost need to be addressed."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Cognitive impairment, unfamiliarity with technology
Source: "These findings are very intriguing as a basis for direct comparison between cultural perception of affective emotion."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement observed, with longer duration in repeated sessions
Source: "Results from the OME showed a trend of longer duration of engagement with the robot from session 1 (9 min 35 s) to session 3 (18 min 1 s)."

## acceptance
Answer: Positive reception from clinicians, caregivers, and PwD
Source: "Results revealed robot-assisted cognitive engagement sessions are feasible in India (and more broadly LMICs), and a trend of longer duration of engagement with the robot was observed."

## trust
Answer: Not explicitly measured
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Feasibility of robotic telemedicine for dementia support, cultural adaptation is critical, high engagement in repeated sessions
Source: "Results demonstrate the capacity to deliver telemedicine cognitive engagement and mental health support through the hybrid face robot."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include technical issues and small sample size for PwD
Source: "One fundamental limitation of the pilot study conducted in India using the robotic telemedicine interface was that only one person with dementia participated."

## testing_context
Answer: Lab settings in the UK, clinical settings in India
Source: "Experiments with healthy participants in the United Kingdom demonstrating the robot's ability to adapt facial expressions to users' speech in real-time."
