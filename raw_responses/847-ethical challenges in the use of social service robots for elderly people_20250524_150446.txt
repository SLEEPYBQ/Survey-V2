## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Participants suffering from dementia are mentioned.
Source: The robot patrols corridors, offers information on a touchscreen, can be called to the reception to guide visitors to offices and accompanies physiotherapy walking groups, playing music and stimulating participants suffering from dementia by means of sounds and a picture gallery.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs include avoiding isolation, maintaining dignity, and ensuring privacy. Expectations include the robot's ability to engage in natural conversation.
Source: The more we can communicate with robots, the less we might communicate with human beings, especially senior adults who are impaired in their mobility.

## application_context
Answer: Care institutions and domestic use for elderly support
Source: Socially assistive robots are increasingly discussed as solutions in care and domestic use for the support of senior adults.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Ethical analysis and practical deployment observations
Source: This article aims to provide a brief overview of the major issues identified so far.

## care_type
Answer: Elderly care and dementia therapy
Source: The objective is usually to engage patients with dementia in interaction and thus activate and motivate them.

## robot_type
Answer: Autonomous and mobile robot platform with anthropomorphic features
Source: Meet Henry! An autonomous and mobile robot platform with a green covering and anthropomorphic features roams through the corridors of an Austrian care institution.

## robot_name
Answer: Henry
Source: Meet Henry! An autonomous and mobile robot platform with a green covering and anthropomorphic features roams through the corridors of an Austrian care institution.

## design_goal
Answer: To support senior adults and address ethical principles like nonmaleficence, beneficence, autonomy, and fairness
Source: Ethical principles of nonmaleficence, beneficence, autonomy and fairness should be transposed to robotics.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Patrolling corridors, offering information on a touchscreen, guiding visitors, accompanying physiotherapy walking groups, playing music, and stimulating dementia patients
Source: The robot patrols corridors, offers information on a touchscreen, can be called to the reception to guide visitors to offices and accompanies physiotherapy walking groups, playing music and stimulating participants suffering from dementia by means of sounds and a picture gallery.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Music and picture gallery for dementia patients, guiding visitors
Source: The robot patrols corridors, offers information on a touchscreen, can be called to the reception to guide visitors to offices and accompanies physiotherapy walking groups, playing music and stimulating participants suffering from dementia by means of sounds and a picture gallery.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Touchscreen not suitable for wheelchair users, navigation failures, and privacy concerns
Source: Henry has a touchscreen suitable for people standing but not necessarily for older persons sitting in wheelchairs.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Vulnerability of elderly and dementia patients, limited technology experience
Source: The perception of vulnerable persons, their needs, their limited resilience and also limited experience with technology have to be at the centre of deployments of SSRs.

## engagement
Answer: N/A

## acceptance
Answer: N/A

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Ethical challenges include privacy, data protection, safety, isolation, loss of autonomy, and deception. Ethical guidelines are essential for robot deployment.
Source: The main areas where ethical reflection is decisive are: privacy, data protection, safety and also the question whether the functionalities of a robot might not tend to lead to isolation, loss of autonomy, overstressing of users and/or deception.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include novelty effects and lack of long-term evidence with robots.
Source: What is overlooked in such studies are novelty effects, improvement brought on by group activities in general and also the problem of patronizing or infantilization of senior adults suffering from dementia.

## testing_context
Answer: Care institution corridors and outpatient areas
Source: The robot patrols corridors, offers information on a touchscreen, can be called to the reception to guide visitors to offices and accompanies physiotherapy walking groups.
