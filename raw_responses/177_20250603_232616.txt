## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals aged 65+ and nursing staff
Source: Sixteen eligible participants participated in the study and received a group robot-assisted therapy using a seal-like robot pet for 30 minutes twice a week for 4 weeks.

## sample_size
Answer: 12 participants completed the study
Source: A total of 12 participants completed the study.

## country
Answer: Taiwan
Source: The study was conducted in a residential care facility in Taiwan.

## age
Answer: Average age was 77.25 (SD 6.7)
Source: The participants' average age was 77.25 (SD 6.7).

## gender
Answer: 75% male, 25% female
Source: There were more males (75%) than females (25%).

## demographic_background
Answer: 58.4% had no formal education, 75% spoke Taiwanese, 41.7% spoke Japanese, 83.3% used wheelchairs, Barthel index mean score was 45.42 (SD 28.08)
Source: Over half received no formal education (58.4%). The majority of the participants spoke Taiwanese (75%) and about 41.7% could speak Japanese. The majority used wheelchairs (83.3%), and their Barthel index mean score was 45.42 (SD 28.08).

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Severe level of dependency on activities of daily living (Barthel index mean score 45.42)
Source: Their Barthel index mean score was 45.42 (SD 28.08), indicating that this group of participants were in the severe level of dependency on their activities of daily living.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Improved communication, interaction skills, and activity participation
Source: By interacting with a robot pet, such as Paro, the communication, interaction skills, and activity participation of the older adults can be improved.

## application_context
Answer: Residential care facilities
Source: The robot-assisted therapy can be provided as a routine activity program and has the potential to improve social health of older adults in residential care facilities.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 30 minutes twice a week for 4 weeks
Source: Participants then received a group robot-assisted therapy using Paro, a seal-like robotic pet, for 30 minutes twice a week for 4 weeks.

## methodology
Answer: One-group pre- and posttest design
Source: This pilot study used a one-group pretest and posttest design.

## care_type
Answer: Robot-assisted therapy for social interaction and activity participation
Source: Robot-assisted therapy for improving social interactions and activity participation among institutionalized older adults.

## robot_type
Answer: Seal-like robotic pet
Source: Participants then received a group robot-assisted therapy using Paro, a seal-like robotic pet.

## robot_name
Answer: Paro
Source: Participants then received a group robot-assisted therapy using Paro, a seal-like robotic pet.

## design_goal
Answer: To improve psychological well-being and social interaction
Source: Robot therapy or robot-assisted therapy uses robots as a substitute for animals through human–animal interactions to improve psychological well-being.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Reacts to sounds and touching with body movements, baby seal calls, eyes close and open, understands Japanese, memorizes its name
Source: Paro can react to sounds and touching with body movements, baby seal calls, eyes close and open, and the Paro used in the study especially can understand Japanese and can memorize her own name.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Encourages interaction, improves mood, and enhances social engagement
Source: The participants looked forward to interact with Paro and often asked the nursing staff about the time to meet with Paro, and they were more willingly to come out their own room to join the activity with Paro.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited interaction time due to group setting and one Paro
Source: One of the limitations in our study was the use of group setting with only one Paro during the activity, so the time for each participant interacting with Paro was limited due to the expensive cost of purchasing Paro.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Ability to speak Japanese, willingness to interact
Source: Five participants in our study could speak Japanese, so they often spoke Japanese when they interacted with Paro.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Severe dependency on activities of daily living
Source: Their Barthel index mean score was 45.42 (SD 28.08), indicating that this group of participants were in the severe level of dependency on their activities of daily living.

## engagement
Answer: Significant improvement in activity participation
Source: The participants' mean scores of Activity Participation Scale increased from 8.55 (SD 2.84) at baseline to 11.50 (SD 2.50) at week 4.

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance and interaction with Paro
Source: When the Paro was brought in for the activity, the participants greeted her with smiling and calling out her name.

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Significant improvement in communication and interaction skills and activity participation
Source: Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that participants' communication and interaction skills (z = −2.94, P = 0.003) and activity participation (z = −2.66, P = 0.008) were significantly improved after receiving 4-week robot-assisted therapy.

## additional_info
Answer: Small sample size, one-group design, Hawthorne effect possible
Source: There were some factors that may limit the generalizability of the results of this study. This study used a small convenience sample with a one-group pretest and posttest design.

## testing_context
Answer: Residential care facility activity room
Source: The participants interacted with the Paro in a group setting in an activity room of the facility in the afternoon.
