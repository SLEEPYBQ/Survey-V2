## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Older adults aged 65+, caregivers, and robotics experts
Source: "We recruited individuals and couples living independently in their homes for this study... aged between 67 and 94"

## sample_size
Answer: 11 participants (6 individuals and 3 married couples)
Source: "The remaining 11 participants were aged between 67 and 94 (M = 75.09, SD = 7.18) and consisted of six females and five males"

## country
Answer: United States (Baltimore area)
Source: "We recruited... participants from across the Baltimore area"

## age
Answer: 67-94 years (Mean = 75.09, SD = 7.18)
Source: "The remaining 11 participants were aged between 67 and 94 (M = 75.09, SD = 7.18)"

## gender
Answer: 6 females and 5 males
Source: "consisted of six females and five males"

## demographic_background
Answer: Varied educational levels (vocational to master's degrees), mixed technology experience, primarily white race (10 white, 1 black, 1 Asian), living independently in owned homes
Source: Table 1 showing participants' education levels, races, and "Participants reported being moderately experienced with technology (M = 2.82, SD = 1.17)"

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Mild physical impairment (M = 2.00, SD = 0.77 on 1-5 scale), no reported cognitive impairments
Source: "Participants reported having mild physical impairment (M = 2.00, SD = 0.77)... None of the participants reported having cognitive health conditions"

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Need for familiar programming methods (especially voice-based), concerns about reliability and accessibility, desire for cognitive stimulation
Source: "Participants preferred programming methods involving familiar and direct interactions... Participants expected possible reliability issues... Some participants viewed programming... as a fun, interesting, and stimulating cognitive exercise"

## application_context
Answer: In-home assistance for household tasks and aging in place
Source: "Robots are expected to be key enablers in assisting older adults with aging in place by providing cognitive, social, and physical assistance"

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use (1.5-2.5 hour sessions), first encounter with robot programming
Source: "Each study session took approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours... we explored users' thoughts, experiences, and feedback regarding programming"

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative study combining semi-structured interviews and observations
Source: "We used a combination of semi-structured interviews and observations... analyzed using applied thematic analysis"

## care_type
Answer: Physical assistance with household tasks
Source: "We observed older individuals' and couples' experiences in programming a contemporary robot arm to assist with household tasks"

## robot_type
Answer: 7-DOF robotic arm with 2-finger gripper
Source: "We used a lightweight 7-DOF Kinova Gen3 cobot arm with a 2-finger gripper"

## robot_name
Answer: Kinova Gen3
Source: "We used a lightweight 7-DOF Kinova Gen3 cobot arm"

## design_goal
Answer: Enable older adults to customize robot assistance through end-user programming
Source: "End-user robot programming could enable older adults to better customize robot assistance according to their preferences"

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Kinesthetic teaching for motion programming, waypoint-based programming, gripper operation
Source: "Participants used the Kinova Kortex web app... that allows users to maneuver the robot to different positions by hand using kinesthetic teaching"

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Familiar interaction methods (voice commands), cognitive stimulation, collaborative programming
Source: "Participants who perceived programming the Kinova arm as familiar had more positive programming experiences... Programming with a partner had advantages"

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Kinesthetic teaching requiring physical effort, complex programming steps, unfamiliar interfaces
Source: "The programming method for the Kinova arm lacks accessibility for older adults with changing physical, sensory, and cognitive abilities"

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Technology experience, familiarity with automation, collaborative support
Source: "Participants who were able to tie the programming method back to interactions they were familiar with tended to have an easier and more positive experience"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Physical limitations, lack of technical familiarity, cognitive constraints
Source: "Participants indicated that kinesthetic teaching using the Kinova involved too much friction... pointed out the inaccessibility of the kinesthetic teaching method for older adults with motor restrictions"

## engagement
Answer: Mixed reactions - some found it fun and stimulating, others found it difficult
Source: "Some participants viewed programming the Kinova arm as a fun, interesting, and stimulating cognitive exercise... others indicating that older adults find programming too difficult"

## acceptance
Answer: Initial skepticism but openness after trying, concerns about long-term feasibility
Source: "Participants particularly expressed skepticism that they would be able to program robot assistance... as they get older"

## trust
Answer: Concerns about reliability but improved mental models after programming
Source: "Participants' primary concerns... involved having insufficient or incorrect mental models of how the robot will behave... Programming helped some participants refine their mental models"

## key_findings
Answer: Five key themes: 1) Familiarity with automation shapes expectations, 2) Aging-related changes affect programming, 3) Collaborative programming is beneficial, 4) Programming can be cognitive exercise, 5) Programming improves mental models
Source: "Our study revealed five themes... Familiarity With Other Forms of Automation and Interactions, Changes in Abilities Due to Aging, Multi-User and Collaborative Programming, Cognitive Exercise, and Mental Model Formation"

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, short-term interaction, and focus on relatively healthy older adults
Source: "Our study was limited to participants who require no major assistance with activities of daily living... single interaction sessions... may not have included sufficient time for participants to learn"

## testing_context
Answer: Participants' private homes (houses or condos)
Source: "We conducted study sessions in participants' residences... All participants in our study lived in houses or condos that they owned"
