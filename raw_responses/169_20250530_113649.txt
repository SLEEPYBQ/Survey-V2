## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly care home residents, care staff, and family members
Source: "In total, 253 residents had robot interaction opportunities, and 83 were consented for direct data collection."

## sample_size
Answer: 83 consented residents (61 females and 22 males)
Source: "The 83 care home residents recruited for directly collected data comprised 61 females and 22 males, and represented 32.8% (83/253) of all residents who had access to the robot pets."

## country
Answer: United Kingdom (specifically Cornwall)
Source: "We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial in 8 care homes in Cornwall, United Kingdom."

## age
Answer: Average age of 87.21 years (SD 7.42 years)
Source: "The average age of consented participants was 87.21 years (SD 7.42 years)."

## gender
Answer: 61 females and 22 males
Source: "The 83 care home residents recruited for directly collected data comprised 61 females and 22 males."

## demographic_background
Answer: Care home residents with varying dementia severity (mild to severe), living in residential or nursing care homes
Source: "To allow stratified randomization, staff assessed consenting residents using the Dementia Severity Rating Scale."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Dementia severity scores ranged from 0-54 (mean 32.11, SD 10.52), with 0-18 indicating mild, 19-36 moderate, and 37-54 severe dementia.
Source: "This provides a score ranging from 0 to 54, with 0-18 indicating mild dementia, 19-36 indicating moderate dementia, and 37-54 indicating severe dementia."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs included reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms, loneliness, and agitation; expectations were entertainment, companionship, and anxiety reduction.
Source: "The main reasons recorded in the 'reason for use' of robots were entertainment, anxiety, and agitation."

## application_context
Answer: Care homes for older adults, particularly those with dementia
Source: "Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 8-month study with 4-month intervention period and 4-month qualitative follow-up; interactions ranged from 15 minutes to 24 hours.
Source: "The study, as conducted, comprised a 4-month, parallel, stratified, cluster RCT... followed by a qualitative study over an additional 4 months."

## methodology
Answer: Stratified cluster randomized controlled trial and mixed methods study (quantitative scales and qualitative interviews/calendars)
Source: "We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial... and mixed methods study."

## care_type
Answer: Residential and nursing care for older adults, including dementia care
Source: "Eight residential care facilities... comprising 4 care homes with nursing care and 4 residential-only care homes."

## robot_type
Answer: Animal-like (Joy for All cats and dogs)
Source: "Over 4 months, 4 care homes each received 2 JfA devices (1 cat and 1 dog; intervention group)."

## robot_name
Answer: Joy for All (JfA) cat and dog
Source: "Over 4 months, 4 care homes each received 2 JfA devices (1 cat and 1 dog; intervention group)."

## design_goal
Answer: To improve well-being, reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms, and be affordable
Source: "Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Entertainment, anxiety reduction, agitation reduction, companionship
Source: "The main reasons recorded in the 'reason for use' of robots were entertainment, anxiety, and agitation."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Calming, enjoyment, companionship, reduced anxiety, improved mood
Source: "The qualitative results suggested good adoption, acceptability, and suitability for subjectively lonely individuals."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Breakage, hygiene concerns, some dislike or rejection
Source: "However, there were some incidences of negative responses, such as jealousy and over-attachment, or dislike and rejection."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher dementia severity, loneliness, and social isolation were associated with better acceptance.
Source: "Those who interacted had significantly higher dementia severity scores."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Lower dementia severity and higher social engagement were associated with reduced interaction.
Source: "Residents who were disinterested in the robots were more socially engaged."

## engagement
Answer: 85% of interacting residents had positive engagement; average interaction length was 3.9 hours.
Source: "Among the residents reported to interact with the robots (54/81), 85% (46/54) were reported to have positive experiences."

## acceptance
Answer: 85% of interacting residents had positive experiences; 74% of analyzed residents interacted.
Source: "Among the residents reported to interact with the robots (54/81), 85% (46/54) were reported to have positive experiences."

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development observed, with sustained use and no novelty effect.
Source: "This work suggests no novelty effect and contributes toward understanding robot pet suitability."

## key_findings
Answer: Affordable robot pets reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness, with no novelty effect.
Source: "Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia, including reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness."

## additional_info
Answer: Study limitations include COVID-19 disruptions and inability to blind collaborators.
Source: "However, the trial commenced in January 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic, resultant care home lock downs, staff workloads, and resident deaths meant that we were unable to carry out the RCT as originally planned."

## testing_context
Answer: Care homes in Cornwall, UK
Source: "We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial in 8 care homes in Cornwall, United Kingdom."
