## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, care workers, research staff, family members (daughter)
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman. We asked her daughter lived in different prefecture, a care worker of Mon-san Nagasaki, and our research staff to register the LINE account for PaPeRo.

## sample_size
Answer: 3
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman.

## country
Answer: Japan
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016 at the house for the elderly with the care service, named Mon-san Nagasaki in Togitsu-machi, Nagasaki prefecture.

## culture
Answer: N/A

## age
Answer: 78, 87, 88
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman.

## gender
Answer: 2 women, 1 man
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman.

## demographic_background
Answer: Elderly individuals who could not use smartphones, living in a care service facility
Source: They could not use smartphones. We installed PaPeRo at the living room of each test subjects and connected PaPeRo with the Internet through Wi-Fi router.

## technology_literacy
Answer: Could not use smartphones
Source: They could not use smartphones.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs: interactive communication with younger generation via SNS without using smartphones. Expectations: simple user interface operated by voice.
Source: Elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via SNS without using smartphones. Our proposed robot is basically operated by voice due to realizing the simple user interface.

## application_context
Answer: Interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via existing SNS like LINE
Source: We propose a SNS Agency Robot that can be used for the interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via existing Social Networking Service (SNS).

## testing_context
Answer: House for the elderly with the care service
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016 at the house for the elderly with the care service, named Mon-san Nagasaki in Togitsu-machi, Nagasaki prefecture.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Long-term deployment over 6 weeks, with daily use
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016.

## methodology
Answer: Demonstration experiment with prototype system evaluation
Source: We confirmed the effectiveness of the message destination estimation through the demonstration experiment at the house for the elderly with the care service.

## robot_type
Answer: Human-type robot
Source: We used PaPeRo, which stands for "Partner-type-Personal-Robot", is a personal robot developed by Japanese firm NEC Corporation. It is noted for its cute appearance and facial recognition system.

## robot_name
Answer: PaPeRo
Source: We used PaPeRo, which stands for "Partner-type-Personal-Robot", is a personal robot developed by Japanese firm NEC Corporation.

## design_goal
Answer: Simple user interface operated by voice, message destination estimation without explicit address input
Source: Our proposed robot is basically operated by voice due to realizing the simple user interface. Therefore, we proposed a message exchange learning-type destination estimation method that enables elderly people not to express a message destination address explicitly.

## robot_general_function
Answer: Voice-operated SNS communication, message destination estimation, message exchange via LINE
Source: Elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via SNS without using smartphones. The replied text message using LINE like "Thanks Grandpa!" by the granddaughter will be sent to the elderly person as voice by the SNS Agency Robot.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Voice operation (simple interface), automatic message destination estimation, visual notification (ears shining for new messages), automatic speech playback when user approaches
Source: Our proposed robot is basically operated by voice due to realizing the simple user interface. The ears of PaPeRo will shine, so that the elderly person can know that new messages have arrived. When the elderly person closes to PaPeRo, PaPeRo starts to speak automatically.
