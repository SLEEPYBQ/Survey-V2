## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Older adults (aged 65+) who participated in the survey
Source: "we included 191 older adults for statistical analysis (Female = 135, age *M* = 77.33)."

## sample_size
Answer: 191 older adults
Source: "we included 191 older adults for statistical analysis (Female = 135, age *M* = 77.33)."

## country
Answer: Korea
Source: "Young Hoon Oh, Jaewoong Kim, Soyon Jeong and Da Young Ju are with Yonsei University, Incheon, 21983 Korea" and "The inclusion criteria were identical with [18]; 244 healthy older adults responded to our survey..."

## age
Answer: Mean age 77.33; grouped as young-old (65–74), middle-old (75–84), and oldest-old (85+)
Source: "age *M* = 77.33" and "we grouped the subjects by age: young-old (aged 65 to 74), middle-old (aged 75 to 84), and oldest-old (aged over 85)"

## gender
Answer: 135 females, remainder males (out of 191 participants)
Source: "we included 191 older adults for statistical analysis (Female = 135, age *M* = 77.33)."

## demographic_background
Answer: Living arrangement (living alone, living with spouse, living with family) was recorded; all participants were healthy older adults recruited from four senior care centers.
Source: "we recruited older adults at four different senior care centers to minimize the cultural bias... Demographics (gender, age, living arrangement)"

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Depression measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form in Korean (SGDS-K); participants grouped as HIGH (score ≥8) or LOW.
Source: "Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form in Korean (SGDS-K) [30], [31]... we grouped the participants who scored 8 or more as HIGH. The other participants were grouped as LOW."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Older adults prefer companion robots that are light in weight, have soft materials (especially microfibers), and for those living alone, a bear-like appearance; concerns include manageability and ease of cleaning.
Source: "those living alone prefer a bear-like robot and negative to the heavy robot... robot designers consider not only the softness of the material but also the detachable/washable hardware design"

## application_context
Answer: Companion robots envisioned for psychological support and social interaction for older adults, especially those living alone.
Source: "companion robots, which provide psychological assistance to older adults through social interaction, have been proposed"

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Single-session, cross-sectional survey and hands-on evaluation of robot types, weights, and materials; no long-term deployment.
Source: "First, we briefed the participants about the purpose of the survey. Then, all participants signed their informed consent and answered Sections A and B... we guided the experiments to all subjects in the following order: Type, Weight, and Material."

## methodology
Answer: Quantitative survey with hands-on evaluation and statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-tests)
Source: "The questionnaire included the following items... we guided the experiments to all subjects in the following order: Type, Weight, and Material... we present statistical analysis on the design elements by gender, age, and living arrangement."

## care_type
Answer: Psychological care (focus on depression, loneliness, and well-being)
Source: "companion robots, which provide psychological assistance to older adults through social interaction"

## robot_type
Answer: Stuffed animal-like robots (dog, baby seal, bear, newborn baby) and a humanoid robot; also, dog-shaped robots with varying weights; material panels for tactile evaluation.
Source: "The subjects were given four stuffed toys and a humanoid robot, as shown in Fig. 1... we used an identical animal as a reference, dog... we developed a 'material test panel'"

## robot_name
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## design_goal
Answer: To determine older adults’ preferences for companion robot design elements (type, weight, material), especially for those living alone, to inform suitable robot design.
Source: "Our primary goal was to determine how companion robots should be designed, paying special attention to older adults who live alone."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Light weight and soft materials (especially microfibers) enhance user preference; bear-like appearance preferred by those living alone.
Source: "As the robot's weight increases, the preference on the robot has decreased... microfibers were the most preferred material... older adults who live alone significantly preferred bear-like robots"

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Heavy weight and plastic or synthetic fiber materials (less soft, harder to clean) reduce user preference; humanoid appearance less preferred.
Source: "they were negative to the heavy robot... synthetic fibers are not as soft as microfibers, but are susceptible to contamination... the humanoid felt stiff owing to its plastic surface material"

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Female older adults living alone showed higher preference for bear-like robots; lower depression associated with higher preference for certain types/materials.
Source: "Female older adults who live alone had higher preference on the bear compared to other groups... LOW significantly preferred the dog-type robot"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Higher depression among those living alone associated with lower preference for heavier robots and synthetic fiber materials.
Source: "highly depressed LA significantly preferred lighter weights... HIGH was significantly negative to the synthetic fibers than LOW"

## engagement
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## acceptance
Answer: Preferences measured via 5-point Likert scale for robot type, weight, and material; higher acceptance for bear-like, light, and soft robots.
Source: "Then, they responded to Question 1 on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree)."

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Older adults living alone are more depressed and prefer bear-like, light, and soft (microfiber) companion robots; living arrangement significantly affects design preferences.
Source: "As a result, they were much more depressed than those living with others, and showed high preference toward bear-type robots. They were negative to the heavy robot. The results of the research showed that various characteristics of the elderly need to be considered to provide a design suitable for them."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include focus on only five robot types, possible lack of full understanding of companion robots by participants, and no long-term or qualitative analysis.
Source: "However, these results are limited to the five types of robots... they might have not fully understood the concept because most of them have not experienced the robot... In the future, we will minimize experimental factors that may produce biased results and provide a qualitative analysis to supplement the limitations of the study."

## testing_context
Answer: Senior care centers
