## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals aged 78-88, caregivers, and research staff
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman. We asked her daughter lived in different prefecture, a care worker of Mon-san Nagasaki, and our research staff to register the LINE account for PaPeRo.

## sample_size
Answer: 3 elderly participants (78, 87, and 88 years old)
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman.

## country
Answer: Japan
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016 at the house for the elderly with the care service, named Mon-san Nagasaki in Togitsu-machi, Nagasaki prefecture.

## age
Answer: 78, 87, and 88 years old
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman.

## gender
Answer: 1 woman (78), 1 man (87), and 1 woman (88)
Source: The test subjects were a 78 years old woman, 87 years old man, and 88 years old woman.

## demographic_background
Answer: Elderly individuals who could not use smartphones, living in a care service facility
Source: They could not use smartphones. We installed PaPeRo at the living room of each test subjects and connected PaPeRo with the Internet through Wi-Fi router.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly people want to have more tight connection with society and communicate interactively via SNS without using smartphones.
Source: Current services are not enough for elderly people who want to have more tight connection with society. Elderly people can communicate with younger generation interactively via LINE using neither smartphones nor personal computers.

## application_context
Answer: Interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via LINE in a care service facility
Source: We proposed a SNS Agency Robot that can be used for the interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via existing Social Networking Service (SNS).

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use over 6 weeks, with daily interactions
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system from 14 Nov. 2016 to 27 Dec. 2016.

## methodology
Answer: Demonstration experiment with prototype system evaluation
Source: We confirmed the effectiveness of the message destination estimation through the demonstration experiment.

## care_type
Answer: Elderly care service with remote communication support
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system at the house for the elderly with the care service.

## robot_type
Answer: Human-type robot
Source: We used PaPeRo, which stands for "Partner-type-Personal-Robot", is a personal robot developed by Japanese firm NEC Corporation.

## robot_name
Answer: PaPeRo
Source: We used PaPeRo, which stands for "Partner-type-Personal-Robot", is a personal robot developed by Japanese firm NEC Corporation.

## design_goal
Answer: Simple voice-operated interface for elderly people to use SNS without smartphones
Source: Our proposed robot is basically operated only by voice due to realizing the simple user interface.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Voice-based message sending/receiving via LINE, message destination estimation
Source: Elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via SNS without using smartphones. We proposed a message exchange learning-type destination estimation method.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Voice operation simplifies SNS use for elderly; message destination estimation reduces user effort
Source: Elderly people can communicate only by voice due to realizing the simple user interface. The message exchange learning-type method enables elderly people not to express a message destination address explicitly.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Speech recognition errors (90.5% accuracy) may affect message destination estimation
Source: Speech recognition accuracy was 90.5%. This accuracy affects the precision of the elderly person's message destination estimation method.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Elderly participants enjoyed using the robot; younger generation could use familiar LINE interface
Source: Just after starting experiment, all test subjects enjoyed using PaPeRo. Younger generation can also communicate with elderly people interactively using their accustomed LINE and smartphones.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Physical condition of two elderly participants worsened during experiment
Source: Unfortunately, the physical condition of 87 years old man and 88 years old woman turned worse during experiment period.

## engagement
Answer: Elderly participants enjoyed using the robot initially
Source: Just after starting experiment, all test subjects enjoyed using PaPeRo.

## acceptance
Answer: Demonstrated by continued use and enjoyment of the system
Source: Just after starting experiment, all test subjects enjoyed using PaPeRo.

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Achieved >80% message destination estimation accuracy; voice interface enabled SNS use for elderly
Source: We confirmed that we were able to achieve the message destination estimation probability of more than 80% at the last period of the demonstration experiment.

## additional_info
Answer: Physical health issues affected participation; used external cloud services for quick deployment
Source: The physical condition of 87 years old man and 88 years old woman turned worse during experiment period. We designed the SNS Agency Robot based on the service-oriented architecture that enables us easily to use external cloud-based services.

## testing_context
Answer: House for the elderly with care service in Nagasaki, Japan
Source: We had an experiment to evaluate our prototype system at the house for the elderly with the care service, named Mon-san Nagasaki in Togitsu-machi, Nagasaki prefecture.
