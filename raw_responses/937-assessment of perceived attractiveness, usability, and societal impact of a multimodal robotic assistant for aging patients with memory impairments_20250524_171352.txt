Source: Both groups' samples consisted of the participants with 11–16 years of education and 60–81 years old. The participants of the RAMCIP prototype evaluation trials consisted of the elderly volunteers, inhabitants of the Lublin voivodeship.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: MCI participants had memory impairments interfering with daily activities (CDR median = 0.5, GDS median = 3) and global cognition level MMSE WS = 25 points.
Source: The average participant from the MCI group suffers from the memory impairments that interfere with his daily activities (CDR median = 0.5, GDS median = 3) and his/her global cognition level is MMSE WS = 25 points.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Participants perceived RAMCIP as non-obtrusive, decreasing caregivers' burden, enhancing everyday functioning, and improving security and quality of life.
Source: Based on the results obtained, and in particular the sub-questions generalized into the clusters mentioned below, the participants perceived the implemented solutions as: non-obtrusive (47–58%), decreasing caregivers' burden (41–53%), enhancing everyday functioning of the patient by: facilitating communication 41–47%, positively influencing the mood and behavior of the user 41–47%, positively influencing the functioning of the user 41–52%.

## application_context
Answer: Home environment for elderly individuals with memory impairments
Source: The aim of the present study is to present the results of the assessment of clinical application of the robotic assistant for patients suffering from mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and Alzheimer Disease (AD).

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use with session durations varying from 3–15 minutes per scenario
Source: The length of the onetime scenario execution varied: Fall detection ∼3–5 min, Assistance in turning off electrical appliance ∼10 min, Assistance upon detection of abnormalities related to electric appliances during cooking ∼10 min, Assistance (proactive/on demand) for fallen objects ∼7 min, Taking medication/food supplements- reminders, brining and monitoring ∼15 min, Proactive bringing of a bottle of water ∼10 min, Proactive communication with relatives and friends ∼5 min.

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys (UEQ, AttrakDiff), and societal impact inventory
Source: The methods of evaluation applied consist of User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), AttrakDiff and the societal impact inventory tailored for the project purposes.

## care_type
Answer: Support for independent living and assistance with daily activities for elderly with memory impairments
Source: The aim of the present study is to present the results of the assessment of clinical application of the robotic assistant for patients suffering from mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and Alzheimer Disease (AD).

## robot_type
Answer: Multimodal robotic assistant with mobile platform, elevation mechanism, and dexterous hand
Source: The robot is equipped with two displays to provide support for multimodal communication. The upper tablet/display, shows the animated emotional facial expression corresponding to the situation and the verbal comments given by the robot. Additionally, the robot's elevation mechanism and the dexterous hand allow it to fetch objects desired by the user but in difficult to reach places for an elderly person.

## robot_name
Answer: RAMCIP (Robotic Assistant for MCI Patients at home)
Source: The prototype version of the Robotic Assistant for MCI patients at Home (RAMCIP) was tested in a semi-controlled environment at the Department of Neurology (Lublin, Poland).

## design_goal
Answer: To support independent living of elderly persons with memory impairments by providing proactive help in everyday living at home
Source: The RAMCIP project's main objectives are providing the person with the robotic assistant that proactively and discretely monitors the user's actions in order to give a needed level of support to prolong satisfying, independent living at home.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Medication intake monitoring, hazardous event prevention, meal preparation assistance, social interaction facilitation, and fetching objects
Source: During the scenarios, RAMCIP facilitated users in medication intake, meal preparation and communication with a relative. RAMCIP also reacted to potentially hazardous events. RAMCIP's mobile platform and elevation mechanism enabled reaching high spots and in a proactive manner, supporting in this way the user's activity. Required objects could be fetched by a dexterous manipulation hand.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Proactive monitoring, fetching objects, multimodal communication, and reminders; these features enhance user independence and safety.
Source: The implemented interface allows the user to communicate in an intuitive and comfortable way with RAMCIP and the external persons. The robotic assistant initially reminds the user of the set of activities and, if declined, informs the caregiver by sending a text message of the user's reaction. If the user supports the activity but shows high fatigue RAMCIP offers physical help with fetching the pillbox to the user.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Neutral usability ratings due to short interaction time; perceived as less efficient.
Source: The usability of the device was reported as neutral due to the short time of interaction. The relatively low value of the efficiency subscale may be connected with the developmental level of the project and will be treated as a guideline for the final RAMCIP version.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher education, prior experience with technology, and lower anxiety toward new technology; these traits correlate with better acceptance.
Source: The elder population is heterogeneous in terms of reported frequency and previous experience with information technologies. On this basis, it is essential to provide a diverse group of users not only in terms of general features like gender, education level and economic status, but in terms of the perceived self-efficiency too.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Lower self-efficacy in technology use and higher anxiety toward robots; these traits correlate with reduced acceptance.
Source: The correlation between age, gender, education and the frequency of the modern technology usage has been observed as well. The users with the most experience and, therefore, the lowest levels of anxiety combined with the highest levels of self-efficiency are called "silver surfers."

## engagement
Answer: High engagement reported, with no significant differences between healthy and MCI groups.
Source: The results show a positive evaluation of RAMCIP within several UEQ scales. No statistical differences between groups in all the subscales have been reported.

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptance reported, with no significant differences between healthy and MCI groups.
Source: The results obtained from the preliminary RAMCIP evaluation by the users show a high level of acceptance among several UEQ subscales.

## trust
Answer: Gradual trust development reported, with no significant differences between groups.
Source: The results obtained have low subscale values and coefficient values which should suggest reluctance of the participants to give polarized opinions.

## key_findings
Answer: RAMCIP was highly assessed for attractiveness and societal impact, with neutral usability ratings due to short interaction time. No differences were observed between healthy and MCI groups.
Source: The robotic assistant societal impact and attractiveness were highly assessed. The usability of the device was reported as neutral due to the short time of interaction. No differences between the groups of subjects were observed in terms of perceived attractiveness, usability nor-societal impact of the device.

## additional_info
Answer: Study limitations include small sample size and short interaction time. Future work will include more participants and longer interactions.
Source: The results described above are based on small groups, therefore the results obtained may be biased by the group size effect. The further investigation of the evaluation approach taken will be introduced during the pilot trials with the second version of RAMCIP. More participants are going to be invited to the study, therefore the reported limitation herein will be decreased.

## testing_context
Answer: Semi-controlled environment at the Department of Neurology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland
Source: The clinical application of the robotic assistant RAMCIP, i.e., the first tests of the HRI, was conducted in the semi-controlled environment at the premises of the Department of Neurology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.
