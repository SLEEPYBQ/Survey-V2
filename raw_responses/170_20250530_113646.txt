Answer: 30 elderly participants  
Source: "The study was conducted with 30 participants between the ages of 67 and 90"  

## country  
Answer: Israel  
Source: "All participants lived in either an apartment (83%) or private home (17%)" (implied by context and author affiliations)  

## age  
Answer: 67-90 years (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29)  
Source: "30 participants between the ages of 67 and 90 (M = 78.5, SD = 7.29)"  

## gender  
Answer: 10 male, 20 female  
Source: "10 male, 20 female"  

## demographic_background  
Answer: 83% lived in apartments, 17% in private homes; 60% fully independent, 20% mainly independent, 7% slightly dependent, 13% somewhat dependent  
Source: "All participants lived in either an apartment (83%) or private home (17%)... 60% of the participants were completely independent... 20% were mainly independent... 7% were slightly dependent... 13% were somewhat dependent"  

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment  
Answer: Cognitively intact (confirmed via informal assessment); no physical impairment data reported  
Source: "Participants that were recruited from the campus database (53.3%) have undergone a formal cognitive assessment... an informal cognitive assessment was performed with all participants"  

## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Need for independence, control, authenticity, and fear of being replaced; preference for assistive over social functions  
Source: "Four user needs that can be threatened by the introduction of home robots: the need for independence, the need for control, the fear of being replaced, and the need for authenticity"  

## application_context  
Answer: Home use for healthy older adults  
Source: "Robotic devices for older adults are becoming a reality... with an emphasis on supporting the positive aspects of aging"  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: One-time interviews (no long-term deployment); session duration: 5-10 min per robot video  
Source: "After viewing each video, a 5–10 min semi-structured interview was conducted"  

## methodology  
Answer: Qualitative interviews and thematic analysis  
Source: "We conducted 30 in-depth interviews... We used the affinity diagram and thematic coding methods"  

## care_type  
Answer: Assistive and social care (focused on healthy aging)  
Source: "New robots are being introduced for the growing subpopulation of healthy older adults"  

## robot_type  
Answer: PR2 (creature-like), Nao (creature-like), Paro (creature-like), ElliQ (object-like), Google Home (object-like), Cozmo (object-like)  
Source: "The six devices were: PR2, Nao, ElliQ, Cozmo, Paro, and the Google Home"  

## robot_name  
Answer: PR2, Nao, ElliQ, Cozmo, Paro, Google Home  
Source: "The six devices were: PR2, Nao, ElliQ, Cozmo, Paro, and the Google Home"  

## design_goal  
Answer: Address user needs (independence, control, authenticity, fear of replacement) via function, speech, appearance, size, proactivity, and mobility  
Source: "We provide recommendations regarding how researchers and designers of home robots can better address the user needs"  

## robot_concern_function  
Answer: Assistive (e.g., cleaning, reminders) and social (e.g., companionship)  
Source: "Participants were open to both assistive and social functions, but had different reservations for each type"  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Assistive tasks (cleaning, reminders), small size, non-intrusive appearance  
Source: "Participants rejected assistance in activities they found personally meaningful... preferred smaller devices"  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Proactivity, mobility, speech, companion-focused design  
Source: "Participants rejected proactive robots... mobility was perceived as unfavorable... speech was often rejected"  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Preference for meaningful tasks, control over robot actions, authenticity  
Source: "Participants believed the robot should have a clear function... require authenticity"  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Fear of replacement, loss of independence, discomfort with artificial companionship  
Source: "Fear of being replaced... concern that the robot will 'replace' them"  

## engagement  
Answer: Mixed reactions; some appreciated social cues, others rejected companionship  
Source: "Participants did appreciate social cues... but strongly conveyed their rejection when social interaction was the main function"  

## acceptance  
Answer: Contingent on addressing user needs; higher for assistive functions  
Source: "Cognitively-intact older adults are willing to adopt robotic devices into their homes, contingent upon their preferences and concerns being addressed"  

## trust  
Answer: N/A (not explicitly measured)  
Source: Not found in the paper  

## key_findings  
Answer: Older adults accept robots if design addresses independence, control, authenticity, and fear of replacement; prefer assistive over social functions  
Source: "Four user needs that can be threatened... participants were open to both assistive and social functions"  

## additional_info  
Answer: Limitations include potential interviewer bias, video-based interaction, and sample specificity  
Source: "Our study has several limitations... video studies are a known method... qualitative studies rely on honesty"  

## testing_context  
Answer: Participants' homes  
Source: "The interviews were conducted in the living room of each of the older adults' homes"
