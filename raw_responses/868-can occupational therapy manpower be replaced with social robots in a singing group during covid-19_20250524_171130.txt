## application_context
Answer: Elderly care centers during COVID-19 outbreak
Source: This study compares therapeutic factors of singing group activities directed by social robots and by occupational therapists at elderly care centers during this COVID-19 outbreak.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Eight sessions of group singing therapy activities, supervised by either social robots or occupational therapists, each session lasting 40 minutes
Source: The subjects received eight sessions of group singing therapy activities, supervised by either social robots or occupational therapists. Each singing-group therapy session included 5–10 minutes of warm-up activities, 40 minutes of main group activities, and then 10 minutes of group report and discussion.

## methodology
Answer: Quasi-experimental research design
Source: This project adopted quasi-experimental research design.

## care_type
Answer: Singing group therapy
Source: This study compares therapeutic factors of singing group activities directed by social robots and by occupational therapists at elderly care centers during this COVID-19 outbreak.

## robot_type
Answer: Social robot
Source: This study adopted the Zenbo® social robot (ASUS Company, Taipei, Taiwan), which can play songs and music, lead a singalong and play videos.

## robot_name
Answer: Zenbo
Source: This study adopted the Zenbo® social robot (ASUS Company, Taipei, Taiwan)

## design_goal
Answer: To reduce direct contact infections and enable flexibility in the use of medical manpower during COVID-19
Source: Using robots can reduce COVID-19 contact infections and enable flexibility in the use of medical manpower.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Play songs and music, lead a singalong, and play videos
Source: This study adopted the Zenbo® social robot (ASUS Company, Taipei, Taiwan), which can play songs and music, lead a singalong and play videos.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Group cohesiveness, altruism, and existential factors scored higher in robot-led sessions
Source: Robot-assisted singing group therapy sessions had the highest scores in group cohesiveness, altruism and existential factors, at both weeks 4 and 8.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Imparting of information, catharsis, and imitative behavior scored lower in robot-led sessions
Source: Three therapeutic factors had higher scores in the occupational therapist's sessions than in the robot's sessions — imparting of information, catharsis and imitative behavior, and the difference was statistically significant.

## acceptance
Answer: Acceptance of robot-led singing therapy increased over time

## key_findings
Answer: Social robots may replace manpower for parts of group activity, but therapist-led sessions still score higher in most therapeutic factors
Source: Social robots may replace manpower for parts of group activity. Three therapeutic factors — group cohesiveness, altruism and existential factors — have shown higher effectiveness scores when singing group therapy is conducted by the robot. In most cases, singing group therapy sessions supervised by real-person therapists still score higher than those conducted by robots in terms of therapeutic factors.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, focus on only singing group therapy, and use of only one type of social robot
Source: This study has some limitations. First, the number of sample cases is too small, at only 14 sample cases divided into two groups. Second, this investigation used only singing group therapy, and the results may not apply to other types of group therapy. Third, the only social robot adopted in this investigation was Zenbo®.
