## methodology
Answer: Pilot study with human participants, testing of listening, sentiment analysis, and emergency protocol functions
Source: A pilot study was conducted under GW IRB #051616 with 2 human participants. The accuracy of the listening function, negative sentiment prediction, positive sentiment prediction and stroke detection algorithm were performed.

## care_type
Answer: Stroke detection and emergency response, social companionship
Source: The proposed robotic system shows the capability of automatically detecting cerebrovascular events all while functioning as a social companion.

## robot_type
Answer: Small mobile robotic platform with human-like natural communication capabilities
Source: In this study, we propose the utilization of a small mobile robotic platform with human-like natural communication capabilities like voice and gestures in order to provide an acceptable user interaction and promote health monitoring through our human-robot interaction framework.

## robot_name
Answer: Rob Bitt
Source: We present a robotic system named "Rob Bitt," a stroke detection companion that continuously monitors a patient's condition in order to detect signs of potential cerebrovascular events and implements an appropriate emergency response.

## design_goal
Answer: Promote happiness, detect strokes, and provide emergency response
Source: In order to promote happiness, the human-robot interactions were designed to have a positive tone and clear purpose. The robotic system utilizes the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) protocol for cerebrovascular event detection.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Stroke detection using EMS FAST protocol, sentiment analysis, social interaction
Source: The robotic system utilizes the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) protocol for cerebrovascular event detection, which is initiated when the user reports feeling unwell in addition to having abnormally high blood pressure. The robotic system also analyzes the user's sentiment.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Stroke detection, sentiment analysis, social interaction, emergency response
Source: The robotic system is capable of automatically detecting cerebrovascular events all while functioning as a social companion. It also provides a health record of the user's measured blood pressure and sentiment.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Computational power limitations causing delayed responses
Source: One of the limitations that the study faced was the computational power of JetBot. While fast and powerful for a compact robot, some of the machine learning algorithms were constrained by the CPU of JetBot and resulted in a delayed response in conversations and sentiment analysis.
