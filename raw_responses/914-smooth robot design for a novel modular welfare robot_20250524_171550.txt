## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly residents, caregivers, robotics experts, and professionals from Ølby elderly care center
Source: "The development is based on a participatory design process and by taking strengths and limitations of selected, commercially available robots into account."

## sample_size
Answer: 2 residents and 4 caregivers participated in the formative evaluation
Source: "During the evaluation, we engaged 2 residents, both males, and 4 caregivers, all females, in enacting the three use cases."

## country
Answer: Denmark
Source: "The development is based on a participatory design process and by taking strengths and limitations of selected, commercially available robots into account. This work contributes a design methodology specific for welfare robots and a resulting robot concept that address three use cases in a care center."

## demographic_background
Answer: Elderly care center residents and professional caregivers
Source: "The development is based on a participatory design process and by taking strengths and limitations of selected, commercially available robots into account. This work contributes a design methodology specific for welfare robots and a resulting robot concept that address three use cases in a care center."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Some residents had dementia, with potential for irritation or aggression triggered by certain colors or designs
Source: "The residents affected by severe dementia could react violently to colors like black or red."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs include assistance with logistics (laundry/garbage), drink serving, and guidance; expectations include polite interaction, safety, and clear machine-like appearance
Source: "Core needs identified in expert workshops were the prevention of falls and the detection of emergencies."

## application_context
Answer: Elderly care centers for tasks like laundry transport, drink serving, and guiding residents
Source: "The concept includes multi-modal robot perception that facilitates a proactive robot behavior for achieving smooth interactions with end-users."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use with formative evaluation sessions
Source: "During the evaluation, we engaged 2 residents, both males, and 4 caregivers, all females, in enacting the three use cases."

## methodology
Answer: Participatory design, ethnographic observation, focus group interviews, co-design workshops, and formative evaluation
Source: "The design process for the robot concept started by following a participatory design (PD) approach."

## care_type
Answer: Elderly care support, including logistics, drink serving, and guidance
Source: "The development is based on a participatory design process and by taking strengths and limitations of selected, commercially available robots into account."

## robot_type
Answer: Modular welfare robot with minimal anthropomorphic features
Source: "The SMOOTH robot follows a technical framework based on ROS like the HOBBIT robot."

## robot_name
Answer: SMOOTH robot (Penguin design)
Source: "The design concept of the Penguin was chosen for further conceptualization."

## design_goal
Answer: Affordability, modularity, simplicity, and acceptability
Source: "In order to facilitate the acceptance of a welfare robot by the staff, patients, and residents in hospitals and elderly care facilities, it is required to design the appearance and behavior of the robots in an appropriate way to ensure the dignity of the humans interacting with the robot."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Logistics (laundry/garbage transport), drink serving, and guiding residents
Source: "The concept includes multi-modal robot perception that facilitates a proactive robot behavior for achieving smooth interactions with end-users."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Multi-modal sensor integration, proactive control, and modular attachments for different tasks
Source: "The control scheme of the SMOOTH robot combines two main components: 1) Multi-sensory integration for adaptively combing different sensor types (e.g., vision, sound, laser rangefinder) and 2) proactive control for autonomous learning to anticipate human behaviors and to perform proactive responses."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Lack of arms limits independent task execution; complex drink serving requirements may reduce practicality
Source: "One of the caregivers asked why the robot does not have any arms, as arms would enable the robot to grasp on things and be more independent in specific tasks."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Openness to technology, politeness in interaction, and clear communication of robot's machine-like nature
Source: "Imagining the robot as an assistant and tool was commented positively, however, one of the residents commented that 'it had to look like a machine!'"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Dementia may cause irritation or aggression; specific health needs complicate drink serving
Source: "The residents affected by severe dementia could react violently to colors like black or red."

## engagement
Answer: Positive engagement during formative evaluation, with active participation in enacting use cases
Source: "In conclusion, the participants expressed curiosity and interest for our mock-up and actively engaged in enacting the scenarios."

## acceptance
Answer: Generally positive, with caregivers and residents providing constructive feedback
Source: "In conclusion, the participants expressed curiosity and interest for our mock-up and actively engaged in enacting the scenarios."

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: The robot should have minimal anthropomorphic features, avoid irritating colors, and clearly appear as a machine; modular design is feasible for multiple tasks
Source: "The appearance of a welfare robot should be designed with minimal anthropomorphic features and only provide limited features, e.g. resembling a face to facilitate interaction."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include small sample size (only male residents and female caregivers) and technical constraints (lack of arms)
Source: "Moreover, in this test we involved only male residents and female caregivers. This could undermine the validity of our insights for the totality of the residents."

## testing_context
Answer: Ølby elderly care center (ØECC)
Source: "The development is based on a participatory design process and by taking strengths and limitations of selected, commercially available robots into account. This work contributes a design methodology specific for welfare robots and a resulting robot concept that address three use cases in a care center."
