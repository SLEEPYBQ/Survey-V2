## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, caregivers, and robotics experts
Source: We assembled a group of 6 participants who work together in a multidisciplinary academic research team.

## sample_size
Answer: 6 participants (5 provided photographs and responses, all 6 participated in the group interaction)
Source: We assembled a group of 6 participants who work together in a multidisciplinary academic research team. Five provided pictures and responses as described above, and all 6 participated in the group interaction.

## country
Answer: Not explicitly stated in the paper
Source: Not found in the paper

## age
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## gender
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## demographic_background
Answer: Multidisciplinary academic research team members
Source: We assembled a group of 6 participants who work together in a multidisciplinary academic research team.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: To discover shared narratives and build group coherence
Source: Our narrative companion extends the human capability to make social narrative links for building group coherence through sharing experience.

## application_context
Answer: Homes for the elderly and group settings
Source: When people are put together in arbitrary conditions, as in a home for the elderly, it can be difficult for them to share experience.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use with a single session lasting 47 minutes
Source: The actual interaction had a total duration of over 47 minutes.

## methodology
Answer: Case study with qualitative and quantitative measures
Source: The system is validated in a case study where participants provide 5 favorite photographs and short answers to questions.

## care_type
Answer: Social and emotional care to enhance group cohesion
Source: The principal function of the narrative companion V2.0 is to discover and mediate narrative relations between members of the group that it animates, in order to aid in the creation and maintenance of the coherence of the group.

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid robot
Source: Pepper is a 1.2m bimanual humanoid with articulated head, arms, hands, and torso mounted on a mobile base, by Softbank Robotics, designed for social interaction with humans.

## robot_name
Answer: Pepper
Source: Based on these requirements, and extending our previous work, we implement the V2.0 narrative companion on the Pepper robot.

## design_goal
Answer: To discover and mediate narrative relations between group members to aid in group coherence
Source: The principal function of the narrative companion V2.0 is to discover and mediate narrative relations between members of the group that it animates, in order to aid in the creation and maintenance of the coherence of the group.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Narrative Semantic Similarity Analysis (NarSim) to generate a meaningful trajectory of narrative linking people and events depicted in photographs
Source: The Narrative Semantic Similarity Analysis System (NarSim) generates a meaningful trajectory of narrative linking people and events depicted in the photographs.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: NarSim system identifies semantic relations between photo descriptions, Pepper animates group interaction
Source: The NarSim system was able to generate an engaging group narrative that held the participant's engagement and attention for over 45 minutes of interaction.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Academic background and familiarity with technology
Source: We assembled a group of 6 participants who work together in a multidisciplinary academic research team.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## engagement
Answer: High engagement during 47-minute interaction
Source: Participants were highly engaged during the entire duration. The average interaction period per picture was 5 minutes 17 seconds.

## acceptance
Answer: Increased affinity towards the robot after interaction
Source: As a result of this interaction, the participants displayed an increased affinity towards the robot (as revealed by question group A and IOS).

## trust
Answer: Increased judgement that the robot could understand the photos after interaction
Source: An increased judgement that the robot could understand the photos (as revealed by question group B).

## key_findings
Answer: The narrative companion successfully increased group cohesion and participant engagement
Source: The important result of this research is that recent advances in semantic interpretation of language can allow social robots to engage in rich interactions with humans.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include the small sample size and specific academic background of participants
Source: We assembled a group of 6 participants who work together in a multidisciplinary academic research team.

## testing_context
Answer: Academic research setting
Source: We assembled a group of 6 participants who work together in a multidisciplinary academic research team.
