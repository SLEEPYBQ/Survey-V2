Here is the structured response to the research paper analysis:

---

## Involved Stakeholder
Elderly individuals (aged 65+), caregivers (implied in scenarios), robotics experts, and technical solution providers (researchers).  
Source: "Ten elderly individuals (four men and six women) aged 65 years or older... participated in the group interviews." / "A seven-point questionnaire was administered to ten experts (five men and five women) in the field of robotics."

## Sample Size
- Elderly participants: 20 (preference evaluation), 10 (group interviews).  
- Robotics experts: 10.  
Source: "20 prospective users... aged 65+" / "Ten elderly individuals... participated in the group interviews." / "Ten experts... in the field of robotics."

## Country
South Korea.  
Source: "Department of Design Engineering, Tech University of Korea, Siheung 15073, South Korea."

## Age
Elderly participants: 65+ years.  
Source: "Ten elderly individuals... aged 65 years or older."

## Gender
Elderly: 4 men, 6 women (group interviews); unspecified for other evaluations. Experts: 5 men, 5 women.  
Source: "Ten elderly individuals (four men and six women)" / "Ten experts (five men and five women)."

## Demographic Background
Elderly: Living context implied (home/care settings); no explicit socioeconomic or educational details. Experts: Professional background in robotics.  
Source: Scenarios describe interactions in daily routines (e.g., medication reminders, exercise).

## Cognitive And Physical Impairment
Not explicitly stated, but scenarios imply support for age-related needs (e.g., dementia prevention games).  
Source: "The robot suggests dementia-prevention games to bored users."

## Needs And Expectations
Elderly: Emotional support, companionship, assistance with daily tasks (e.g., medication reminders). Caregivers: Monitoring, emergency response.  
Source: "The robot checks the person's status and waits for an emergency call." / "Facilitate robot interactions that foster natural emotional connections."

## Application Context
Home/care settings for elderly emotional care.  
Source: "Social robots that interact with elderly individuals and provide them with emotional care."

## Process Of The Care
Short-term interactions (e.g., greetings, exercise encouragement) integrated into daily routines.  
Source: Scenarios span morning to bedtime interactions (Table 2).

## Methodology
Mixed-methods: Qualitative (group interviews, scenario design), quantitative (surveys, preference evaluations with 7-point scales).  
Source: "Group interviews using a mood meter" / "Preference evaluation using a seven-point scale."

## Care Type
Emotional and social support, daily task assistance.  
Source: "Emotional care through affective support."

## Robot Type
Human-like social robot with 2D display face and upper-body gestures.  
Source: "Full-face 2D display being the most common" / "Upper body movements play a greater role."

## Robot Name
Not specified (referred to as "social robot").  
Source: N/A.

## Design Goal
Natural, human-like emotional expressions to enhance user comfort and interaction.  
Source: "Enable robots to express emotions in a manner similar to humans."

## Robot Concern Function
Facial expressions (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, cheeks) and gestures (upper-body movements) for six emotions.  
Source: "Designed robot facial expressions and gestures for six emotions."

## Facilitating Functions
- **Facial expressions**: Geometric shapes, standardized components (e.g., eyes, mouth).  
- **Gestures**: Human-like motion patterns (e.g., waving, nodding).  
Source: "Geometric shapes were deemed the most appropriate." / "Derived kinematics... to inform humanlike robot gestures."

## Inhibitory Functions
- **Facial expressions**: Overly exaggerated features (e.g., squinted eyes).  
- **Gestures**: Unnatural speed/range (e.g., "insufficient to convey emotion").  
Source: "Users indicated that facial expressions were overly exaggerated."

## Stakeholder Facilitating Characteristics
- **Elderly**: Preference for geometric, intuitive designs.  
- **Experts**: High scores for contextually appropriate emotions.  
Source: "Type B face design... achieved the highest mean score (5.55)."

## Stakeholder Inhibitory Characteristics
- **Elderly**: Difficulty with overly complex/mechanical gestures.  
Source: "Users noted that gestures lacked sufficient expression of concern."

## Engagement
High engagement with natural expressions (e.g., "joyful" gestures rated 5.6 post-adjustment).  
Source: "Revised designs... average score was 5.5 or higher."

## Acceptance
Positive acceptance of finalized designs (e.g., "loving" emotion rated 5.9).  
Source: "Preference evaluation results were statistically significant."

## Trust
Implied through emotional bonding; no explicit metrics.  
Source: "Foster deep emotional bonds between robots and users."

## Key Findings
Optimized facial/gesture designs enhance emotional interactions; geometric faces and human-like gestures preferred.  
Source: "Developed facial expression and gesture designs for six emotions... enabling natural emotional connections."

## Additional Info
Limitations: Single emotion intensity per design; cultural variability not addressed.  
Source: "Constrained by... single facial expression and gesture for each emotion."

## Testing Context
Lab-based evaluations (implied from video presentations).  
Source: "25 potential elderly users were presented with a video of the HRI design."
