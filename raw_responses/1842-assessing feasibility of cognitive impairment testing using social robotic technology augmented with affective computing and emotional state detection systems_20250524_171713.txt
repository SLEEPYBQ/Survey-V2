Answer: 20 elderly participants
Source: We recruited 23 patients but we only included 20 patients in the analysis due to missing data.

## country
Answer: Italy
Source: The experimental scenario was set up within the healthcare facilities of the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Research Hospital in San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.

## age
Answer: Mean age was 75.35 ± 7.86 years
Source: The mean age was 75.35 ± 7.86 years.

## gender
Answer: 85% male (17 males, 3 females)
Source: The total number of male users was 85% (with a male/female rate of 17/3).

## demographic_background
Answer: Educational level in years was 9.95 ± 4.63. Patients were recruited from the hospitalized older adults in the Rehabilitation Medicine Unit.
Source: On average, the educational level in years was 9.95 ± 4.63. The patients were recruited from the hospitalized older adults in the Rehabilitation Medicine Unit.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: MMSE score >18, ADL index ≥4. Cognitive status categories: Cognitive impairment (CI; MMSE < 24.0), Mild cognitive impairment (MILD CI; MMSE < 27.0 and ≥ 24.0), No cognitive impairment (NO CI; MMSE ≥ 27.0).
Source: We enrolled 20 patients aged over 60 with an Activity Daily Living (ADL) index ≥4 and with a traditionally computed MMSE score >18.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Patients appreciated the robot for its likability and perceived intelligence. Willingness to interact with the robot was a key factor for positive user experience.
Source: Patients perceived the Pepper robot as intelligent and likable. The willingness to interact appeared to influence domains such as the perception of anthropomorphism, animacy, likability, perceived intelligence, and safety by the patient.

## application_context
Answer: Clinical practice for administering cognitive tests, specifically the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
Source: This study investigated the feasibility of employing an assistive robot to administer cognitive tests in clinical practice. In particular, the robot Pepper was used to administer the MMSE to a geriatric population.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Short-term use during a single session for MMSE administration. Session duration was not explicitly stated.
Source: The interaction with the robot lasted only as long as the test was administered.

## methodology
Answer: Mixed methods including quantitative surveys (AMQ, SUS, RAQ, Godspeed, UEQ) and qualitative analysis of physiological responses via CPM.
Source: The quality of the human–robot interaction (HRI) was monitored by administering questionnaires and evaluating the patients' physiological responses.

## care_type
Answer: Cognitive impairment testing and geriatric care
Source: The aim of this study is to validate the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test administered by the Pepper robot equipped with systems to detect psychophysical and emotional states in older patients.

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid social robot
Source: Pepper, a humanoid social robot developed by the Japanese Aldebaran (United Robotics Group) company, is one of the most popular social robots available on the market.

## robot_name
Answer: Pepper
Source: Pepper, a humanoid social robot developed by the Japanese Aldebaran (United Robotics Group) company.

## design_goal
Answer: To administer the MMSE autonomously and monitor patients' psycho-physiological and emotional states during interaction.
Source: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the differences between the scores obtained in the MMSE test performed in the traditional way by a psychologist or other health professional and those obtained by administering the same test using the robotic system described in the following sections.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Administering the MMSE test, detecting psychophysical and emotional states via CPM.
Source: The robot Pepper was used to administer the MMSE to a geriatric population. The quality of the human–robot interaction (HRI) was monitored by administering questionnaires and evaluating the patients' physiological responses.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Likability, perceived intelligence, and low anxiety levels during interaction. The robot was perceived as useful, effective, and engaging.
Source: Patients perceived the Pepper robot as intelligent and likable. The AMQ highlighted low levels of anxiety during the HRI, and the RAQ revealed the good acceptability of the robot.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Poor intelligibility of the robot's voice and latency in reactions. Patients often asked the psychologist to repeat questions.
Source: Two of the main limitations of this study are the poor intelligibility of the robot's voice and the latency with which the robot sometimes reacted to the patient's responses.

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Willingness to interact with the robot, positive attitude, and lower anxiety levels.
Source: The willingness to interact with the robot had an important impact on the user experience. Patients with a probable willingness to interact appreciated the robot Pepper with respect to the others.

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Lower educational level influenced perception of novelty, intelligence, and enjoyment. Gender imbalance (85% male) may limit generalizability.
Source: A lower educational level seemed to influence the perception of the novelty, intelligence, and perceived enjoyment and sociability of the robot. The gender imbalance (85% male) may limit generalizability.

## engagement
Answer: High engagement with 94% of affective states showing medium or high arousal, and 50.48% showing positive valence.
Source: 94% of the ASs measured were indicative of medium or high arousal, 50.48% of the ASs measured were characterized by both medium-high arousal and positive valence.

## acceptance
Answer: High acceptability with low anxiety levels (AMQ score: 4.63 [3.94–5.00]) and positive evaluations in RAQ domains.
Source: The AMQ highlighted low levels of anxiety during the HRI, and the RAQ revealed the good acceptability of the robot.

## trust
Answer: Trust score in AMQ was 3.50 [1.00–4.00].
Source: Trust in AMQ was 3.50 [1.00–4.00].

## key_findings
Answer: Pepper robot can administer MMSE effectively. Cognitive status did not affect usability. Willingness to interact was a key factor for positive user experience.
Source: The results demonstrated that Pepper was able to successfully administer the MMSE to patients since the scores obtained in the test were not statistically different from those obtained when the MMSE was administered through standard in-person delivery by a healthcare specialist.

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include poor voice intelligibility, latency, small sample size, and gender imbalance. Future work aims to improve spontaneity and fluidity of interaction.
Source: Two of the main limitations of this study are the poor intelligibility of the robot's voice and the latency with which the robot sometimes reacted to the patient's responses. Another limitation is related to the small study sample (low statistical power) and its gender imbalance.

## testing_context
Answer: Healthcare facilities of the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Research Hospital in San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.
