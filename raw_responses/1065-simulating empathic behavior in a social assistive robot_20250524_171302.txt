## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, caregivers, robotics experts
Source: "The robot's empathic behaviors have been evaluated both by experts in communication and through a user study aimed at assessing the perception and interpretation of empathy by elderly users."

## sample_size
Answer: 18 elderly participants
Source: "Both studies were carried out with the same sample of eighteen participants (N=18), in a recreation center for elderly people."

## country
Answer: Italy

## age
Answer: Average age 75.6 with a 10.5 standard deviation
Source: "Their average age was 75.6 with a 10.5 standard deviation."

## gender
Answer: Equally distributed by gender
Source: "All participants were older than 65 and were equally distributed by gender."

## application_context
Answer: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments
Source: "When used as an interface in the context of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), a social robot should not just provide a task-oriented support."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Expert-based evaluation and user study
Source: "The NICA prototype was evaluated both by experts and through user study."

## care_type
Answer: Social and affective support
Source: "It should also try to establish a social empathic relation with the user."

## robot_type
Answer: Human-like
Source: "The NAO robot by Aldebaran"

## robot_name
Answer: NICA
Source: "The name of the project, NICA, is also used to indicate the robot."

## design_goal
Answer: To simulate empathic behaviors in the context of AAL
Source: "In this paper we describe how such an affective reasoning has been implemented in the NAO robot for simulating empathic behaviors in the context of AAL."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Recognizing user's affective state and triggering empathic behaviors
Source: "In particular, the robot is able to recognize the emotion of the user by analyzing communicative signals extracted from speech and facial expressions."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Emotion recognition, empathic behavior simulation
Source: "The recognized emotion allows triggering the robot's affective state and, consequently, the most appropriate empathic behavior."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## engagement
Answer: High engagement in empathic interactions
Source: "Results are quite satisfactory and encourage us to further extend the social and affective capabilities of the robot."

## acceptance
Answer: Positive acceptance of empathic behaviors
Source: "Results were quite satisfactory since in both experiments empathic behavior was perceived correctly."

## trust
Answer: Increased trust through empathic interactions
Source: "establish a social long-term empathic relation with the user and increase the user's trust."

## key_findings
Answer: Empathic behaviors were perceived correctly, with cognitive empathy more recognized than affective empathy
Source: "The results of the second study did not reveal differences due both to gender and age in participants. All the subjects perceived as empathic the behavior of NICA during the interaction with the actor."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include lack of facial expressions in the NAO robot
Source: "In part, this may be due to the absence of facial expressions in the NAO robot."

## testing_context
Answer: Recreation center for elderly people
Source: "Both studies were carried out with the same sample of eighteen participants (N=18), in a recreation center for elderly people."
