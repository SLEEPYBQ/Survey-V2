Source: "Focus groups were attended by 67 participants. A total of 22 frail older adults (77% female), with a mean age of 80 years-old (range: 65–90 y.o.) participated in 4 focus groups in all the three countries. Seventeen relatives of older adults (88% female) with a mean age of 55 years-old (range: 46–64 y.o.) participated in 3 focus groups in Germany and Spain. Twenty health professionals (80% female) with a mean age of 46 years-old (range: 30–61y.o.) and 8 professional caregivers (5 women, 3 men) with a mean age of 51 years-old (range: 27–60 y.o.), participated in 4 focus groups in all the three countries."

## country
Answer: Germany, Italy, Spain
Source: "Participants were recruited (in Germany, Italy and Spain) from among non-institutionalized people experiencing initial difficulties in activities of daily living (ADL), usually classified as frail older individuals."

Seventeen relatives of older adults (88% female) with a mean age of 55 years-old (range: 46–64 y.o.)... Twenty health professionals (80% female) with a mean age of 46 years-old (range: 30–61y.o.) and 8 professional caregivers (5 women, 3 men) with a mean age of 51 years-old (range: 27–60 y.o.)"

## gender
Answer: Frail older adults: 77% female; family caregivers: 88% female; health professionals: 80% female; professional caregivers: 5 women, 3 men
Source: "A total of 22 frail older adults (77% female)... Seventeen relatives of older adults (88% female)... Twenty health professionals (80% female) and 8 professional caregivers (5 women, 3 men)"

## demographic_background
Answer: Frail older adults: non-institutionalized with initial ADL difficulties; family caregivers: unpaid; professional caregivers: >5 years experience; health professionals: medical and administrative roles
Source: "Frail older adults were recruited from among non-institutionalized people experiencing initial difficulties in activities of daily living (ADL)... Family caregivers were individuals with personal experience in caring for a relative or friend and who performed these duties pro bono. Professional caregivers... had more than 5 years of experience. Health professionals were professionals involved in health attention both directly (medical doctors, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, etc.) and/or indirectly (health service administrators, advisors)."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Frailty characterized by loss of capabilities, unstable health, reduced reserve capacity; participants had hip/wrist/leg fractures, pain, mobility problems
Source: "Frail participants were identified in each country by means of being categorized as frail by the different services involved in each country having heterogeneous conditions: hip, wrist or leg fractures, pain, mobility problems and other comorbidities."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Support for physical tasks, IADLs, cognitive support, emergency monitoring, social interaction, privacy, safety
Source: "The users require support with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, especially with sequential tasks and housework (i.e. carrying heavy objects, cooking)... The users require Cognitive Support (i.e. arranging and reminding appointments, reminding medicines intake)... The users require Monitorization in case of Emergencies... The users require Social interaction and communication with others... The users want their Privacy to be respected... The users want Safety in their caring process."

## application_context
Answer: Domestic environments for independent living
Source: "The 'Multi-Role Shadow Robotic System for Independent Living' (SRS) project has developed a remotely-controlled, semi-autonomous robotic system to be used in domestic environments."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Focus groups, individual interviews, ethnographic approach
Source: "We selected three different procedures in order to meet the users' needs from different perspectives: (1) focus groups... (2) interviews... and, (3) an ethnographic procedure, based in a home visit."

## care_type
Answer: Support for independent living, assistive technology
Source: "The 'Multi-Role Shadow Robotic System for Independent Living' (SRS) project has developed a remotely-controlled, semi-autonomous robotic system to be used in domestic environments."

## robot_type
Answer: Wheeled mobile platform with robotic arm
Source: "The robot was a wheeled mobile platform equipped with a robotic arm, capable to be operated through remote control to perform several tasks."

## robot_name
Answer: Multi-Role Shadow Robotic System for Independent Living (SRS)
Source: "The 'Multi-Role Shadow Robotic System for Independent Living' (SRS) project has developed a remotely-controlled, semi-autonomous robotic system."

## design_goal
Answer: To support frail older adults in domestic environments, addressing physical tasks, IADLs, cognitive support, emergencies, privacy, and safety
Source: "The objective of this paper is to document the iterative procedure used to identify, select and prioritize user requirements... The list of user requirements, ordered according to impact, number and transnational criteria, revealed a high number of requirements related to basic and instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive and social support and monitorization, and also involving privacy, safety and adaptation issues."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Remote-controlled operation, object manipulation, emergency monitoring, cognitive reminders, social interaction
Source: "The robot was a wheeled mobile platform equipped with a robotic arm, capable to be operated through remote control to perform several tasks (such as grabbing objects, carrying objects and using adapted electric devices)... The systems can help with daily living activities such as reaching, fetching and carrying objects that are heavy or out of reach."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Support for physical tasks (e.g., carrying objects), cognitive reminders, emergency monitoring, social interaction
Source: "The users require support with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, especially with sequential tasks and housework (i.e. carrying heavy objects, cooking)... The users require Cognitive Support (i.e. arranging and reminding appointments, reminding medicines intake)... The users require Monitorization in case of Emergencies... The users require Social interaction and communication with others."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Privacy concerns, safety issues
Source: "The users want their Privacy to be respected, but each user has different privacy interests... The users want Safety in their caring process."

## key_findings
Answer: 74 requirements identified, prioritized for physical tasks, IADLs, cognitive support, emergencies, privacy, and safety; users more interested in support for IADLs than basic ADLs
Source: "Finally 74 requirements with different levels of specification, depending on the nature of the approach (qualitative or quantitative), were found and elaborated... The users were more interested in having an electronic device that would provide support in tasks that they could no longer perform autonomously rather than having a smart-interactive machine."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include difficulty homogenizing data from different methodologies; future studies should use standardized assessment protocols
Source: "Regarding limitations, this study represents a descriptive approach in which several methodologies (quantitative and qualitative) were used to obtain a broad knowledge of the old users from different points of view. It was difficult to homogenize data from different levels and formats. Future studies should include the final data categories into well-designed assessment protocols in order to make it possible to analyse data in the same levels."

## testing_context
Answer: Home environments
Source: "An ethnographic approach was carried out in order to consider new specific contextual requirements... through field visits, ranging from 40 to 60 min in a unique session."
