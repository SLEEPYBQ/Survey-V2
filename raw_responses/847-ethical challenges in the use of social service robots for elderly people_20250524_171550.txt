## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Dementia and mobility impairments are mentioned, but no specific scores or scales are provided.
Source: "Participants suffering from dementia" and "persons in wheelchairs."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly individuals expect natural conversation and understanding from robots, while caregivers and staff seek ethical deployment and safety.
Source: "People were quickly frustrated by failing to communicate with the robot."

## application_context
Answer: Care institutions and domestic settings for elderly support
Source: "Socially assistive robots are increasingly discussed as solutions in care and domestic use for the support of senior adults."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Qualitative analysis of ethical challenges and case studies
Source: "This article aims to provide a brief overview of the major issues identified so far."

## care_type
Answer: Elderly care and dementia support
Source: "Socially assistive robots are increasingly discussed as solutions in care and domestic use for the support of senior adults."

## robot_type
Answer: Anthropomorphic robot (Henry) and PARO robotic seal
Source: "Henry is part of the European science project STRANDS" and "the PARO robotic seal."

## robot_name
Answer: Henry and PARO
Source: "Meet Henry!" and "the PARO robotic seal."

## design_goal
Answer: To support senior adults while addressing ethical principles like nonmaleficence, beneficence, autonomy, and fairness
Source: "Ethical principles of nonmaleficence, beneficence, autonomy and fairness should be transposed to robotics."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Navigation, information provision, guiding visitors, and therapeutic interaction (e.g., playing music for dementia patients)
Source: "The robot patrols corridors, offers information on a touchscreen, can be called to the reception to guide visitors to offices and accompanies physiotherapy walking groups."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Navigation, information provision, and therapeutic interaction (e.g., music for dementia patients)
Source: "The robot patrols corridors, offers information on a touchscreen, and accompanies physiotherapy walking groups, playing music."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Limited accessibility for wheelchair users and inability to engage in natural conversation
Source: "Henry has a touchscreen suitable for people standing but not necessarily for older persons sitting in wheelchairs."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Openness to technology and understanding of robot capabilities
Source: "Informing senior adults in a comprehensible way about the real capabilities and limitations of robots is essential."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Vulnerability, limited resilience, and lack of experience with technology
Source: "The perception of vulnerable persons, their needs, their limited resilience and also limited experience with technology have to be at the centre of deployments."

## engagement
Answer: Mixed reactions, including frustration and emotional attachment
Source: "People were quickly frustrated by failing to communicate with the robot" and "aged participants in a study formed emotional attachments to a robot."

## acceptance
Answer: Mixed acceptance due to unmet expectations and ethical concerns
Source: "People were quickly frustrated by failing to communicate with the robot."

## trust
Answer: Concerns about deception and privacy reduce trust
Source: "The issues of expectations and deception cannot therefore be easily ignored."

## key_findings
Answer: Ethical challenges include privacy, safety, deception, and dignity. Guidelines are needed for ethical deployment.
Source: "The main areas where ethical reflection is decisive are: privacy, data protection, safety and also the question whether the functionalities of a robot might not tend to lead to isolation, loss of autonomy, overstressing of users and/or deception."

## additional_info
Answer: Limitations include novelty effects and lack of long-term evidence for robot benefits.
Source: "What is overlooked in such studies are novelty effects, improvement brought on by group activities in general."

## testing_context
Answer: Care institutions and domestic settings
Source: "An autonomous and mobile robot platform with a green covering and anthropomorphic features roams through the corridors of an Austrian care institution."
