## involved_stakeholder  
Answer: Older adults aged 65+, caregivers, and robotics researchers  
Source: "We recruited individuals and couples living independently in their homes for this study... aged between 67 and 94."  

## sample_size  
Answer: 11 participants (6 individuals and 3 married couples)  
Source: "The remaining 11 participants were aged between 67 and 94."  

## country  
Answer: United States (Baltimore area)  
Source: "We recruited... participants from across the Baltimore area."  

## age  
Answer: 67–94 years (M = 75.09, SD = 7.18)  
Source: "The remaining 11 participants were aged between 67 and 94 (M = 75.09, SD = 7.18)."  

## gender  
Answer: 6 females and 5 males  
Source: "The remaining 11 participants... consisted of six females and five males."  

## demographic_background  
Answer: Mixed race (White, Black, Asian), varied educational levels (vocational to master's degrees), moderately experienced with technology, some with chronic diseases  
Source: Table 1 details race, education, employment status, and technology experience.  

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment  
Answer: Mild physical impairment (M = 2.00, SD = 0.77 on a 1–5 scale), no reported cognitive impairments  
Source: "Participants reported having mild physical impairment... None of the participants reported having cognitive health conditions."  

## needs_and_expectations  
Answer: Desire for familiar, voice-based programming; concerns about reliability and effort; preference for minimal peripheral devices  
Source: "Participants preferred programming methods involving familiar and direct interactions... speech-based instruction was considered the most intuitive."  

## application_context  
Answer: In-home robot assistance for aging in place (e.g., household tasks like dusting, retrieving items)  
Source: "Robots are expected to be key enablers in assisting older adults with aging in place."  

## process_of_the_care  
Answer: Short-term use (1.5–2.5 hours per session), first encounter with robot programming  
Source: "Each study session took approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours."  

## methodology  
Answer: Qualitative (semi-structured interviews and observations)  
Source: "We used a combination of semi-structured interviews and observations."  

## care_type  
Answer: Physical assistance with daily living activities  
Source: "Physical robot assistance often involves robots helping with daily living activities."  

## robot_type  
Answer: 7-DOF Kinova Gen3 cobot arm with a 2-finger gripper  
Source: "We used a lightweight 7-DOF Kinova Gen3 cobot arm with a 2-finger gripper."  

## robot_name  
Answer: Kinova Gen3  
Source: "We used a lightweight 7-DOF Kinova Gen3 cobot arm."  

## design_goal  
Answer: Enable older adults to customize robot assistance via end-user programming  
Source: "End-user robot programming could enable older adults to better customize robot assistance according to their preferences."  

## robot_concern_function  
Answer: Kinesthetic teaching and waypoint-based programming for tasks like dusting, retrieving items  
Source: "Participants used the Kinova Kortex web app... to maneuver the robot to different positions by hand."  

## facilitating_functions  
Answer: Voice-based programming, familiar interactions (e.g., swiping gestures), cognitive stimulation  
Source: "Speech-based programming was favored... kinesthetic teaching was perceived as intuitive by some."  

## inhibitory_functions  
Answer: Kinesthetic teaching required physical effort; screen-based interface was difficult for visually impaired users  
Source: "Participants indicated that kinesthetic teaching involved too much friction... P3 had difficulty seeing the keyboard."  

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics  
Answer: Familiarity with technology, prior experience with automation, collaborative programming with partners  
Source: "Participants who perceived programming the Kinova arm as familiar had more positive programming experiences."  

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics  
Answer: Mobility restrictions, sensory impairments, unfamiliarity with technical concepts  
Source: "Participants experienced programming difficulties due to aging-related changes... lack of fine motor control."  

## engagement  
Answer: Mixed; some found it fun and stimulating, others found it scary or difficult  
Source: "Some participants viewed programming the Kinova arm as a fun, interesting, and stimulating cognitive exercise."  

## acceptance  
Answer: Varied; some saw long-term utility, others doubted feasibility for older adults  
Source: "Participants particularly expressed skepticism that they would be able to program robot assistance... as they get older."  

## trust  
Answer: Concerns about reliability and mental model accuracy; programming helped refine understanding  
Source: "Participants' primary concerns... involved having insufficient or incorrect mental models of how the robot will behave."  

## key_findings  
Answer: Five themes: familiarity with automation, aging-related changes, collaborative programming, cognitive exercise, and mental model formation  
Source: "Our study findings revealed five themes corresponding to factors that shape participants' expectations, experiences, and preferences."  

## additional_info  
Answer: Limitations include small sample size, short-term interaction, and lack of diversity in health status  
Source: "Our study was limited to participants who require no major assistance with activities of daily living."  

## testing_context  
Answer: Participants' private residences (houses or condos)  
Source: "We conducted study sessions in participants' residences."
