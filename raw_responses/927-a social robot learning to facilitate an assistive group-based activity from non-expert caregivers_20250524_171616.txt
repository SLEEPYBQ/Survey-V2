## methodology
Answer: Robot teaching study (qualitative and quantitative) with caregivers; HRI study (quantitative surveys) with residents
Source: "We conducted a preliminary robot teaching study with caregivers" and "An HRI study with residents was conducted"

## care_type
Answer: Group recreational activities (e.g., Bingo) for cognitive and social stimulation
Source: "Our research focuses on developing SARs that can autonomously facilitate recreational activities with older adults in residential care settings to provide both cognitive and social stimulation."

## robot_type
Answer: Human-like socially assistive robot
Source: "Tangy is a humanlike social robot"

## robot_name
Answer: Tangy

## design_goal
Answer: Enable non-expert caregivers to teach and customize group recreational activities for robots
Source: "Our research focuses on developing SARs that can autonomously facilitate recreational activities with older adults in residential care settings... to learn customized group recreational activities from non-experts"

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Facilitate Bingo games, including calling numbers, providing encouragement, and assisting players
Source: "Tangy learned the game, it autonomously facilitated Bingo games with elderly residents."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Personalized behaviors (e.g., jokes, encouragement) and clear instructions; residents found these helpful and engaging
Source: "The residents found the robot behaviors, personalized by the caregivers, both helpful and entertaining."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Robot movement speed was perceived as slow by some caregivers during teaching
Source: "Participant 4 elaborated by saying that 'the robot should move faster during teaching.'"

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Caregivers' experience with recreational activities; residents' enjoyment of personalized interactions
Source: "They were either recreation programs staff or social services staff, and all were experienced with facilitating Bingo games with residents" and "residents... found the personalized behaviors helpful as well as entertaining"

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Caregivers' limited tech-savviness; residents' mild cognitive impairment
