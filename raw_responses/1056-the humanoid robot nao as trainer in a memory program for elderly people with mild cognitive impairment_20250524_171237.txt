## country
Answer: Italy
Source: "The participants were selected from the population of outpatients attending the Center for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia of AUSL Parma (Italy)."

## age
Answer: Mean age of 73.45 years (SD=7.71), range between 45 and 85 years
Source: "The final number of participants was of 21 individuals (10 females and 11 males) with a mean age of 73.45 years (SD=7.71)."

## gender
Answer: 10 females and 11 males
Source: "The final number of participants was of 21 individuals (10 females and 11 males)."

## demographic_background
Answer: Mean education level of 9.90 years (SD=4.58), ranging from 5 to 18 years
Source: "The mean education level was of 9.90 years (SD=4.58) with a minimum value of 5 years corresponding to the conclusion of the elementary school and a maximum value of 18 years which corresponds to a bachelor degree."

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) based on Petersen guidelines, with preserved daily living activities (ADL and IADL)
Source: "Subjects are enrolled according to the following inclusion criteria: a) diagnosis of MCI obtained through Petersen guidelines, and full marks in the two tests measuring daily living activities (ADL and IADL)."

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: To maintain cognitive capability, improve memory performance, and enhance therapeutic behavior adherence
Source: "Our concern in individuals with MCI is to maintain their cognitive capability while they still have their functional abilities and high levels of quality of life and independence."

## application_context
Answer: Memory-training program in a center for cognitive disorders therapy
Source: "NAO is the experimental platform used in an ecological setting: a center for the treatment of cognitive disorders and dementia of the Italian health service."

## process_of_the_care
Answer: 8-week program with weekly 1.5-hour sessions, involving short-term use
Source: "Here they are involved in programs that last 8 weeks, with weekly meetings of 1 h and a half, conducted in a small group format (6–8 people) by an expert neuropsychologist."

## methodology
Answer: Mixed-methods approach including neuropsychological evaluations, video analysis, and questionnaires
Source: "The video recordings were cut into fragments of equivalent length and analyzed with a specific and customized software to compare the interaction between the participants and NAO or the psychologist."

## care_type
Answer: Memory training for Mild Cognitive Impairment
Source: "This paper describes the study addressed to evaluate the effectiveness of human–robot interaction to reinforce therapeutic behavior and treatments adherence."

## robot_type
Answer: Humanoid robot
Source: "The humanoid robot NAO as Trainer in a Memory Program for Elderly People with Mild Cognitive Impairment."

## robot_name
Answer: NAO
Source: "The humanoid robot NAO as Trainer in a Memory Program for Elderly People with Mild Cognitive Impairment."

## design_goal
Answer: To reinforce therapeutic behavior and treatment adherence, and improve memory performance
Source: "This paper describes the study addressed to evaluate the effectiveness of human–robot interaction to reinforce therapeutic behavior and treatments adherence."

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Memory-training tasks (story reading, questions about the story, word association, word recall, song-singer match)
Source: "The five selected tasks were: 1. Reading stories; 2. Questions about the story; 3. Associated/not associated words; 4. Associated/not associated word recall; 5. Song-singer match."

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Visual gaze increase, therapeutic behavior reinforcement, and reduction of depressive symptoms
Source: "Data indicated that memory training with NAO resulted in an increase of visual gaze from patients and reinforce of therapeutic behavior reducing, in some cases, depressive symptoms."

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Speech recognition errors leading to false positives and false negatives
Source: "With NAO, on the other hand, since the vocal response is possible, many types of errors can arise, namely: 1. NAO incorrectly understands a correct answer (False Negatives). 2. NAO gives a wrong answer (False Positives)."

## stakeholder_facilitating_characteristics
Answer: Higher engagement and positive expressiveness during interaction with NAO
Source: "Significant differences found in the recognizing and naming exercise may be attributed to the required adaptations of the task to make it suitable for NAO."

## stakeholder_inhibitory_characteristics
Answer: Speech recognition errors and procedural peculiarities causing reduced interaction
Source: "Errors accomplished both by NAO and participants during the implementation of the two open question tasks were considered, because that sort of task encompasses a complex interaction."

## engagement
Answer: Increased visual gaze and smiles towards NAO during tasks
Source: "Data indicated that memory training with NAO resulted in an increase of visual gaze from patients and reinforce of therapeutic behavior."

## acceptance
Answer: Positive evaluation in PIADS and SUS questionnaires, with mean SUS score of 68.57
Source: "The System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a usability score of NAO as a device. The mean score found for this scale was of M =68.57."

## trust
Answer: No significant anxiety caused by NAO, as measured by STAI-X
Source: "State anxiety (STAI—X) was also measured after the last interaction with NAO, and the mean general score (M=35.24, SD=10.43) resulted not far from the one of the single groups."

## key_findings
Answer: NAO increased visual gaze, reinforced therapeutic behavior, and unexpectedly improved prose memory and verbal fluency measures
Source: "Data indicated that memory training with NAO resulted in an increase of visual gaze from patients and reinforce of therapeutic behavior reducing, in some cases, depressive symptoms. Unexpectedly, significant changes in prose memory and verbal fluency measures were detected."

## additional_info
Answer: Small sample size and single-center study limit generalizability
Source: "The small number of participants limits this study; however, the focus of the research was on feasibility rather than generalizability."

## testing_context
Answer: Center for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia in Parma, Italy
Source: "NAO is the experimental platform used in an ecological setting: a center for the treatment of cognitive disorders and dementia of the Italian health service."
