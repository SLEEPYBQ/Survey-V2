## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals with dementia, caregivers, and researchers
Source: A total of five participants took part in a comparison study in which they engaged in a free-play session with the robot PLEO and in a free-play session with the robot PLEO within a jungle-themed context.

## sample_size
Answer: 5 elderly participants
Source: A total of five participants took part in a comparison study

## country
Answer: The Netherlands
Source: This study was conducted at a long-term care facility for people with dementia in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, Vitalis Berckelhof.

## age
Answer: Ages 80, 82, 84, 85, and 94
Source: Table 1. Demographics of the participants.

## gender
Answer: 4 female, 1 male
Source: Table 1. Demographics of the participants.

## demographic_background
Answer: Residents of a long-term care facility with dementia
Source: At this facility, there are a total of 24 residents with different stages and forms of dementia living.

## cognitive_and_physical_impairment
Answer: All participants had dementia (Alzheimer's Dementia or Mixed Dementia) with MMSE scores ranging from 9 to 22
Source: Table 1. Demographics of the participants.

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Needs for individual activities, individual care, and social needs
Source: They identified nineteen needs from which the needs for individual activities, individual care, and social needs were proven to be the most important ones.

## application_context
Answer: Long-term care facilities for people with dementia
Source: Improving the quality of life of people with dementia in long-term care facilities is very important and can be achieved by designing engaging activities for the residents.

## process_of_the_care
Answer: Two free-play sessions, each lasting a maximum of 20 minutes, conducted one week apart
Source: The participants were free to interact with the robot for a maximum of 20 min.

## methodology
Answer: Comparison study with qualitative and quantitative analysis of engagement behaviors
Source: The gaze and arm/hand behaviors of the participants were measured and were used to determine the level of their engagement.

## care_type
Answer: Dementia care
Source: Improving the quality of life of people with dementia in long-term care facilities is very important.

## robot_type
Answer: Animatronic dinosaur
Source: During this study, the animatronic dinosaur, PLEO was used.

## robot_name
Answer: PLEO
Source: During this study, the animatronic dinosaur, PLEO was used.

## design_goal
Answer: To enhance engagement through contextual cues
Source: We expected that adding contextual cues to this interaction would enhance the positive engagement of these individuals.

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Expressing human-like emotions, responding to touch, and exploring the environment
Source: PLEO was chosen as it can distinguish different types of touch, it has camera-based vision, and it has the ability to express human-like emotions such as, happiness and grumpiness.

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Ability to express emotions and respond to touch
Source: PLEO was chosen as it can distinguish different types of touch, it has camera-based vision, and it has the ability to express human-like emotions such as, happiness and grumpiness.

## inhibitory_functions
Answer: Added contextual cues decreased interaction
Source: Contrary to our expectations, we found a significant decrease in engagement for the sessions where the context was added to the interaction.

## engagement
Answer: Engagement was measured through gaze and arm/hand behaviors, showing higher engagement without contextual cues
Source: The gaze and arm/hand behaviors of the participants were measured and were used to determine the level of their engagement.

## acceptance
Answer: N/A

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Adding contextual cues decreased interaction but increased gaze duration
Source: The results of our evaluation show that adding a contextual environment to the human-robot interaction decreased the interaction of the elderly.

## additional_info
Answer: Small sample size and potential bias from researcher presence
Source: The main limitation is the small sample size, since we could test with only five participants in two sessions.

## testing_context
Answer: Long-term care facility hallway
Source: The sessions were executed on Wednesday or Friday morning between 10:00 and 13:00 in the hallway of the residential home.
