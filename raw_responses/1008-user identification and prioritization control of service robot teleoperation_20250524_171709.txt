## involved_stakeholder
Answer: Elderly individuals, disabled individuals, relatives, social caregivers, doctors, technical staff
Source: Elderly prefer to be the only ones to do the remote control of the robot, while disabled people would allow the robot to be controlled by their relatives, social caregivers and doctors as it is described in [7].

## sample_size
Answer: 15 elderly participants (aged 66-81) and 15 disabled participants (incapacity rate 59%-90%)
Source: The results showed that 90% from the target group 15 elderly (between 66 and 81 years old) and 15 disabled people (with incapacity rate between 59% and 90%) expressed positive feedback

## needs_and_expectations
Answer: Elderly prefer exclusive control, disabled prefer shared control with relatives/caregivers
Source: Elderly prefer to be the only ones to do the remote control of the robot, while disabled people would allow the robot to be controlled by their relatives, social caregivers and doctors

## application_context
Answer: Home assistance for elderly and disabled
Source: it is suitable for use in home applications, where it could operate in hard to reach, narrow spaces between the furniture and the house environment

## process_of_the_care
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## methodology
Answer: Preliminary user experience tests
Source: it has been performed preliminary user experience tests with Elderly and Disabled

## care_type
Answer: Elderly and disabled care
Source: tele-controlled assistive robot for elderly and disabled care

## robot_type
Answer: Tele-controlled assistive robot with Mecanum wheels
Source: a new version of our tele-controlled assistive robot for elderly and disabled - ROBCO 20 is more maneuverable using Mecanum wheels

## robot_name
Answer: ROBCO 20
Source: ROBCO 20 could monitor user health status

## design_goal
Answer: Improved maneuverability, precise navigation, health monitoring, user identification
Source: replacing differential drive mobile robot platform with holonomic mobile robot platform with Mecanum wheels for improving maneuverability; changing the industrial computer with more powerful INTEL NUC; replacing existing laser scanner with Hokuyo Scanning Laser Rangefinder for precise navigation; integrated wearable device which can detect falls and measure user pulse and temperature

## robot_concern_function
Answer: Health monitoring, medication/food delivery, user identification, remote control
Source: ROBCO 20 could monitor user health status (heart rate, temperature, and fall detection), could support a more active way of living, and could deliver medication, food and drinks. ROBCO 20 could identify users by hi-resolution camera or/and speech recognition

## facilitating_functions
Answer: Mecanum wheels for maneuverability, health monitoring, user identification
Source: ROBCO 20 is more maneuverable using Mecanum wheels; could monitor user health status; could identify users

## engagement
Answer: 90% positive feedback from participants
Source: The results showed that 90% from the target group [...] expressed positive feedback

## acceptance
Answer: Positive feedback about identification and prioritization control
Source: expressed positive feedback about using a user identification and prioritization control for service robot teleportation

## trust
Answer: N/A
Source: Not found in the paper

## key_findings
Answer: Successful implementation of user identification and prioritization control; positive user feedback; improved maneuverability with Mecanum wheels
Source: User identification by visual recognition and verification of the speaker and prioritization control for user classification rights and access to robot control, described in this paper was successfully implemented and evaluated. Compared to the previous differential drive ROBCO 19 robot, a new version [...] is more maneuverable using Mecanum wheels
