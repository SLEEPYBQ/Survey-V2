Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided research paper:

## Involved Stakeholder
Elderly people with Alzheimer's disease, caregivers, and technical solution providers (researchers).

Source: "Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study. They were all clinically diagnosed as AD."

## Sample Size
3 elderly participants (Ms. A, Ms. B, Ms. C).

Source: "Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study."

## Country
Japan.

Source: "We conducted 10 trials (interactions) for each participant... in a group home for seniors with dementia in Osaka, Japan."

## Age
85-96 years old.

Source: "Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study."

## Gender
All participants were female.

Source: "Three female residents (from 85 to 96 years old) of a senior group home participated in this study."

## Demographic Background
Elderly with Alzheimer's disease living in a group home (community-based care facility for mild/moderate demented seniors).

Source: "We described a long-term fieldwork conducted in a group home (a community-based care facility where mild/moderate demented seniors live together)."

## Cognitive And Physical Impairment
All had Alzheimer's disease with varying severity (moderate to severe). Standardized tests used: MMSE (scores 0-17), QOL-D, DBD, NPI-NH, BI, VTI.

Source: "They were all clinically diagnosed as AD... Her MMSE score were 12 (before) and 13 (after), indicating that Ms. A had moderate dementia."

## Needs And Expectations
Seniors needed communication support and motivation to interact. Caregivers needed tools to better understand seniors' conditions.

Source: "It is important for caregivers to motivate seniors with AD to communicate to cope with BPSD and to suppress progress of dementia."

## Application Context
Group home for elderly with dementia, to support long-term communication.

Source: "We discussed the possibilities of using Telenoid as a tool to support long-term communication between people and elderly individuals."

## Process Of The Care
Long-term deployment (3 months), sessions once or twice a week for 15 minutes each.

Source: "The experiments were conducted once or twice a week for 3 months... the duration of the conversations was limited to 15 min each."

## Methodology
Field study with mixed methods: quantitative (standardized tests, questionnaires) and qualitative (video analysis, observations).

Source: "We compared face-to-face communication with communication mediated through Telenoid... evaluated the quality of the conversation by questionnaire."

## Care Type
Communication support and social interaction for elderly with dementia.

Source: "We developed a robot called Telenoid to provide communication support for seniors."

## Robot Type
Teleoperated robot with child-like appearance.

Source: "Telenoid is a teleoperated robot covered with soft vinyl that can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice."

## Robot Name
Telenoid R3b.

Source: "Telenoid R3b (Figure 1)."

## Design Goal
To provide communication support and motivate seniors to interact.

Source: "Telenoid's child-like appearance might attract residents and motivates them to communicate."

## Robot Concern Function
Teleoperation transmitting operator's movements and voice, allowing physical interaction (hugging, touching).

Source: "Telenoid is a teleoperated robot... can transmit a remote operator's physical movements and voice."

## Facilitating Functions
Child-like appearance encouraged interaction, physical contact (hugging) improved engagement.

Source: "They treated Telenoid as a child, which is huggable and easier to touch."

## Inhibitory Functions
Limited non-verbal communication capabilities made interaction difficult for severe AD cases.

Source: "Non-verbal information, like holding hands and eye contact, is important, but communicating this through Telenoid was difficult."

## Stakeholder Facilitating Characteristics
Moderate AD patients showed better engagement; child-like interaction style helped.

Source: "Ms. A and Ms. B had positive reactions from talking with Telenoid."

## Stakeholder Inhibitory Characteristics
Severe AD (Ms. C) had difficulty with verbal communication through the robot.

Source: "Ms. C has severe AD, verbal communication is more difficult with her."

## Engagement
Two participants with moderate AD showed positive engagement (more physical contact, cheerful reactions).

Source: "Two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## Acceptance
Generally positive, especially for moderate AD cases.

Source: "The result indicates that two of the three residents with moderate AD showed a positive reaction to Telenoid."

## Trust
Not explicitly measured, but positive reactions suggest developing trust.

Source: "They became less nervous while communicating with Telenoid from the time they were first introduced to it."

## Key Findings
Telenoid improved communication for moderate AD patients, enabling physical interaction and maintaining interest long-term.

Source: "Our experiment results showed that two participants with moderate AD had positive reactions from talking with Telenoid."

## Additional Info
Limitations: small sample size, no comparison with other robots, potential experimenter bias.

Source: "The experiment did not prove the effect of Telenoid itself... small number of participants."

## Testing Context
Group home (dining room or TV room).

Source: "All conversations were exchanged in a public space, either in the dining room or the TV room."
